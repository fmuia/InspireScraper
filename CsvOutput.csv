Searching for High Frequency Gravitational Waves with Phonons,"Yonatan Kahn, Jan Schütte-Engel, Tanner Trickle",2311.17147,hep-ph,,0,"The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum at frequencies above a kHz is a largely unexplored frontier. We show that detectors with sensitivity to single-phonon excitations in crystal targets can search for GWs with frequencies, $\mathrm{THz} \lesssim f \lesssim 100 \, \mathrm{THz}$, corresponding to the range of optical phonon energies, $\mathrm{meV} \lesssim \omega \lesssim 100 \, \mathrm{meV}$. Such detectors are already being built to search for light dark matter (DM), and therefore sensitivity to high-frequency GWs will be achieved as a byproduct. We begin by deriving the absorption rate of a general GW signal into single phonons. We then focus on carefully defining the detector sensitivity to monochromatic and chirp signals, and compute the detector sensitivity for many proposed light DM detection targets. The detector sensitivity is then compared to the signal strength of candidate high-frequency GW sources, e.g., superradiant annihilation and black hole inspiral, as well as other recent detector proposals in the $\mathrm{MHz} \lesssim f \lesssim 100 \, \mathrm{THz}$ frequency range. With a judicious choice of target materials, a collection of detectors could optimistically achieve sensitivities to monochromatic signals with $h_0 \sim 10^{-23} - 10^{-25}$ over $\mathrm{THz} \lesssim f \lesssim 100 \, \mathrm{THz}$."
Probing Reheating with Graviton Bremsstrahlung,"Nicolás Bernal, Simon Cléry, Yann Mambrini, Yong Xu",2311.12694,hep-ph,,0,"We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum resulting from graviton bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. We focus on an inflaton $\phi$ oscillating around a generic monomial potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$, considering two different reheating scenarios: $i)$ inflaton decay and $ii)$ inflaton annihilation. We show that in the case of a quadratic potential, the scattering of the inflatons can give rise to larger GW amplitude than the decay channel. On the other hand, the GW spectrum exhibits distinct features and redshifts in each scenario, which makes it possible to distinguish them in the event of a discovery. Specifically, in the case of annihilation, the GW frequency can be shifted to values higher than those of decay, whereas the GW amplitude generated by annihilation turns out to be smaller than that in the decay case for $n \geq 4$, due to the different scaling of radiation during reheating. We also show that the differences in the GW spectrum become more prominent with increasing $n$. Finally, we highlight the potential of future high-frequency GW detectors to distinguish between the different reheating scenarios."
Quantum technologies for fundamental (HE) physics,D. Blas,2311.10187,hep-ph,,0,"In this brief contribution I will highlight some directions where the developments in the frontier of (quantum) metrology may be key for fundamental high energy physics (HEP). I will focus on the detection of dark matter and gravitational waves, and introduce ideas from atomic clocks and magnetometers, large atomic interferometers and detection of small fields in electromagnetic cavities. Far from being comprehensive, this contribution is an invitation to everyone in the HEP and quantum technologies communities to explore this fascinating topic."
Constraints on Non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run,"Ryoto Inui, Santiago Jaraba, Sachiko Kuroyanagi, Shuichiro Yokoyama",2311.05423,astro-ph.CO,,1,"The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW), arising from large amplitude primordial density fluctuations, provide a unique observational test for directly probing the epoch of inflation. In this work, we provide constraints on the SIGW background by taking into account the non-Gaussianity in the primordial density fluctuations, using the third observing run (O3) data of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We find that the non-Gaussianity gives a non-negligible effect on the GW energy density spectrum and starts to affect the analysis of the O3 data when the non-Gaussianity parameter is $F_{\rm NL} > 3.55$. Furthermore, the constraints exhibit asymptotic behavior given by $F_{\rm NL} A_g = \rm{const.}$ at large $F_{\rm NL}$ limit, where $A_g$ denotes the amplitude of the curvature perturbations. In the limit of large $F_{\rm NL}$, we placed a 95% confidence level upper limit $F_{\rm NL} A_g \leq 0.13, 0.09, 0.10$ at fixed scales of $10^{16}, 10^{16.5}, 10^{17}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively."
Search for high-frequency gravitational waves with Rydberg atoms,"Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda, Akira Taniguchi",2311.03890,gr-qc,,1,"We propose high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors with Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are sensitive detectors of electric fields. By setting up a constant magnetic field, a weak electric field is generated upon the arrival of GWs. The weak electric field signal is then detected by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the system of the Rydberg atoms. Recently, the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms is further improved by combining superheterodyne detection method. Hence, even the weak signal generated by the GWs turns out to be detectable. We calculate the amplitude of Rabi frequency of the Rydberg atoms induced by the GWs and show that the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms becomes maximum when the size of the Rydberg atoms is close to the wavelength of GWs. As an example, we evaluate the sensitivity of the GW detector with Rubidium Rydberg atoms and find that the detector can probe GWs with a frequency 26.4 GHz and an amplitude approximately around $10^{20}$. We argue that the sensitivity can be further enhanced by exploiting entangled atoms."
Update on gravitational wave signals from post-inflationary phase transitions,"H. Kolesova, M. Laine",2311.03718,gr-qc,,0,"In view of recent interest in high-frequency detectors, broad features of gravitational wave signals from phase transitions taking place soon after inflation are summarized. The influence of the matter domination era that follows the slow-roll stage is quantified in terms of two equilibration rates. Turning to the highest-frequency part of the spectrum, we show how it is constrained by the fact that the bubble distance scale must exceed the mean free path."
Moduli Stabilization in String Theory,"Liam McAllister, Fernando Quevedo",2310.20559,hep-th,,2,"We give an overview of moduli stabilization in compactifications of string theory. We summarize current methods for construction and analysis of vacua with stabilized moduli, and we describe applications to cosmology and particle physics. This is a contribution to the Handbook of Quantum Gravity."
Gravitational Waves from Preheating in Inflation with Weyl Symmetry,"Wei-Yu Hu, Qing-Yang Wang, Yan-Qing Ma, Yong Tang",2311.00239,astro-ph.CO,,0,"Inflation with Weyl scaling symmetry provides a viable scenario that can generate both the nearly scaling invariant primordial density fluctuation and a dark matter candidate. Here we point out that, in additional to the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) from quantum fluctuations, the production of high-frequency GWs from preheating in such inflation models can provide an another probe of the inflationary dynamics. We conduct both linear analytical analysis and nonlinear numerical lattice simulation in a typical model. We find that significant stochastic GWs can be produced and the frequency band is located around $10^8$ Hz $\sim$ $10^9$ Hz, which might be probed by future resonance-cavity experiments."
Primordial black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures,Eleni Bagui,2310.19857,astro-ph.CO,,4,"In the recent years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as one of the most interesting and hotly debated topics in cosmology. Among other possibilities, PBHs could explain both some of the signals from binary black hole mergers observed in gravitational wave detectors and an important component of the dark matter in the Universe. Significant progress has been achieved both on the theory side and from the point of view of observations, including new models and more accurate calculations of PBH formation, evolution, clustering, merger rates, as well as new astrophysical and cosmological probes. In this work, we review, analyse and combine the latest developments in order to perform end-to-end calculations of the various gravitational wave signatures of PBHs. Different ways to distinguish PBHs from stellar black holes are emphasized. Finally, we discuss their detectability with LISA, the first planned gravitational-wave observatory in space."
Entanglement in Cosmology,"Konstantinos Boutivas, Dimitrios Katsinis, Georgios Pastras, Nikolaos Tetradis",2310.17208,gr-qc,,0,"We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. The transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement."
Gravitational Waves from Particle Decays during Reheating,"Shinya Kanemura, Kunio Kaneta",2310.12023,hep-ph,,1,"Gravitational waves have become an irreplaceable tool for exploring the post-inflationary universe. Their cosmological and astrophysical origins have been attracting numerous attention. In this Letter, we point out a novel source of ultra-high frequency gravitational waves: the decay of particles produced during the reheating era. We highlight the decay of the Higgs boson as a representative case, showing how it yields a testable gravitational wave spectrum by future observations."
A Mössbauer Scheme to Probe Gravitational Waves,"Yu Gao, Huaqiao Zhang, Wei Xu",2310.06607,gr-qc,,1,"Under the local gravitational field, perturbations from high-frequency gravitational waves can cause a vertical shift of the M\""ossbauer resonance height. Considering a stationary scheme with the $^{109}$Ag isotope, we demonstrate that the extremely high precision of M\""ossbauer resonance allows for competitive gravitational wave sensitivity from KHz up to above MHz frequencies. M\""ossbauer resonance can offer a novel and small-sized alternative in the quest of multi-band gravitational wave searches. The presence of the static gravitational field plays essential role in the detection mechanism, isotope selection and sensitivity forecast. The proposed stationary scheme's sensitivity has the potential of significant improvement in a low-gravity environment."
On graviton-photon conversions in magnetic environments,"Jai-chan Hwang, Hyerim Noh",2310.04150,gr-qc,,0,"Graviton-photon conversions in a given external electric or magnetic field, known as the Gertsenshtein mechanism, are usually treated using the four-potential for photons. In terms of the electric and magnetic (EM) fields, however, proper identification of the fields in curved spacetime is important. By misidentifying the fields in Minkowski form, as is often practiced in the literature, we show that the final equation for photon conversion is correct in transverse-tracefree gauge only for planar gravitational waves in a uniform and constant external field. Even in the former method, to recover the EM fields from the four-potential in curved spacetime, one should properly take into account the metric involved in the relation. By including the metric perturbation in the graviton conversion equation, we show that a magnetic environment can cause exponential instability term in gravitational wave equation."
Elastic Scattering of Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds: Primordial Black Holes and Stellar Objects,"Marcell Howard, Morgane König",2309.15925,gr-qc,,0,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are plausible dark matter candidates that formed from the gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations. Current observational constraints allow asteroid-mass PBHs to account for all of the cosmological dark matter. We show that elastic scattering of a cosmological gravitational wave background, these black holes generate spectral distortions on the background of 0.3% for cosmologically relevant frequencies. Scattering from stellar objects induce much smaller distortions. Detectability of this signal depends on our ultimate understanding of the unperturbed background spectrum."
Particle accelerators to meet gravitational waves,"Ralph Assmann, Peter McIntosh, Alessandro Fabris, Giovanni Bisoffi, Ivan Andrian",,,10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2023-MOPA080,0,
Gravitational wave search through electromagnetic telescopes,"Asuka Ito, Kazunori Kohri, Kazunori Nakayama",2309.14765,gr-qc,,2,"We study the graviton-photon conversion in the magnetic fields of the Earth, our galaxy, and intergalactic regions. Requiring that the photon flux converted from gravitons does not exceed the observed photon flux with telescopes, we derive upper limits on the stochastic gravitational waves in frequency ranges from $10^{7}$Hz to $10^{35}$Hz. Remarkably, the upper limits on $h^2 \Omega_{{\rm GW}}$ could be less than unity in the frequency range of $10^{18}$-$10^{23}$ Hz in a specific case. The detection of gravitational waves using telescopes would open up a new avenue for high frequency gravitational wave observations and offer exciting opportunities to probe new physics."
High Frequency Gravitational Waves from Pulsar Timing Arrays,"Junsong Cang, Yu Gao, Yiming Liu, Sichun Sun",2309.15069,astro-ph.CO,,5,"Several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments such as NANOGrav and PPTA reported evidence of a gravitational wave background at the nano-Hz frequency band recently. This signal can originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) generated by the enhanced curvature perturbation. Here we perform a joint likelihood inference on PTA datasets, and our results show that if the PTA signals were indeed of SIGW origin, the curvature perturbations amplitude required will produce primordial black holes (PBHs) in $[2 \times 10^{-5}, 2 \times 10^{-2}]\ m_\odot$ mass range. Mergers of these PBHs can leave a strong gravitational wave signature in the $[10^{-3}, 10^8]$ Hz frequency range, to be detectable at upcoming interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope, DECIGO and BBO, etc. This offers a multi-frequency opportunity to further scrutinize the source of the observed PTA signal."
Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection for Dark Sectors,"Yifan Chen, Chunlong Li, Yuxin Liu, Jing Shu, Yuting Yang",2309.12387,hep-ph,,0,"Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities or LC circuits, have emerged as powerful detectors for probing ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the limited resonant bandwidth of conventional single-mode resonators, imposed by quantum fluctuations, necessitates numerous scan steps to cover broad unexplored frequency regions. The incorporation of multiple auxiliary modes can realize a broadband detector while maintaining a substantial signal response. The broadened sensitive width can be on the same order as the resonant frequency, encompassing several orders of the source frequency for heterodyne detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another. Consequently, our approach enables significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection."
Gravitational waves from axion wave production,"Mingqiu Li, Sichun Sun, Qi-Shu Yan, Zhijie Zhao",2309.08407,hep-ph,,2,"We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern-Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave tachyonic instability in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants."
Fast Likelihood-free Reconstruction of Gravitational Wave Backgrounds,"Androniki Dimitriou, Daniel G. Figueroa, Bryan Zaldivar",2309.08430,astro-ph.IM,,0,"We apply state-of-the-art, likelihood-free statistical inference (machine-learning-based) techniques for reconstructing the spectral shape of a gravitational wave background (GWB). We focus on the reconstruction of an arbitrarily shaped signal by the LISA detector, but the method can be easily extended to either template-dependent signals, or to other detectors, as long as a characterisation of the instrumental noise is available. As proof of the technique, we quantify the ability of LISA to reconstruct signals of arbitrary spectral shape (blind reconstruction), considering a diversity of frequency profiles, and including astrophysical backgrounds in some cases. As a teaser of how the method can reconstruct signals characterised by a parameter-dependent template (template reconstruction), we present a dedicated study for power-law signals. While our technique has several advantages with respect to traditional MCMC methods, we validate it with the latter for concrete cases. This work opens the door for both fast and accurate Bayesian parameter estimation of GWBs, with essentially no computational overhead during the inference step. Our set of tools will be integrated into the package GWBackFinder, which will be made publicly available in due time."
Gravitational Wave Science in the Mid-Band with Atom Interferometers,"Sebastian Baum, Zachary Bogorad, Peter W. Graham",2309.07952,gr-qc,,0,"Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been detected in the $\sim 100$ Hz and nHz bands, but most of the gravitational spectrum remains unobserved. A variety of detector concepts have been proposed to expand the range of observable frequencies. In this work, we study the capability of GW detectors in the ""mid-band"", the $\sim 30$ mHz -- 10 Hz range between LISA and LIGO, to measure the signals from and constrain the properties of $\sim 1-100 M_\odot$ compact binaries. We focus on atom-interferometer-based detectors. We describe a Fisher matrix code we use to evaluate their capabilities, and present numerical results for two benchmarks: terrestrial km-scale detectors, and satellite-borne detectors in medium Earth orbit. One unique capability of mid-band GW detectors is pinpointing the location of GW sources on the sky. We demonstrate that a satellite-borne detector could achieve sub-degree sky localization for any detectable source with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c \lesssim 50 M_\odot$. We also compare different detector configurations, including different locations of terrestrial detectors and various choices of the orbit of a satellite-borne detector. As we show, a network of only two terrestrial single-baseline detectors or one single-baseline satellite-borne detector would each provide close-to-uniform sky-coverage, with signal-to-noise ratios varying by less than a factor of two across the entire sky. We hope that this work contributes to the efforts of the GW community to assess the merits of different detector proposals."
Gravitational waves from high-power twisted light,"Eduard Atonga, Killian Martineau, Ramy Aboushelbaya, Aurélien Barrau, Marko von der Leyen",2309.04191,gr-qc,,0,"Recent advances in high-energy and high-peak-power laser systems have opened up new possibilities for fundamental physics research. In this work, the potential of twisted light for the generation of gravitational waves in the high frequency regime is explored for the first time. Focusing on Bessel beams, novel analytic expressions and numerical computations for the generated metric perturbations and associated powers are presented. Compelling evidence is provided that the properties of the generated gravitational waves, such as frequency, polarisation states and direction of emission, are controllable by the laser pulse parameters and optical arrangements."
Macroscopic Quantum Response to Gravitational Waves,"Asuka Ito, Ryuichiro Kitano",2309.02992,gr-qc,,1,"We study the excitation of a one-electron quantum cyclotron by gravitational waves. The electron in such as a penning trap is prepared to be at the lowest Landau level, which has an infinite degeneracy parameterized by the size of the wave function. We find that the excitation rate from the ground state to the first excited state is enhanced by the size of the electron wave function: an electron with a larger wave function feels gravitational waves more. As a consequence, we derive a good sensitivity to gravitational waves at a macroscopic one-electron quantum cyclotron."
On the anisotropies of the cosmological gravitational-wave background from pulsar timing array observations,"Ran Ding, Chi Tian",2309.01643,astro-ph.CO,,3,"Significant evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background has recently been reported by several Pulsar Timing Array observations. These studies have shown that, in addition to astrophysical explanations based on supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), cosmological origins are considered equally important sources for these signals. To further explore these cosmological sources, in this study, we discuss the anisotropies in the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) in a model-independent way. Taking the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 15-year dataset as a benchmark, we estimate the angular power spectra of the CGWB and their cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations and weak gravitational lensing. We find that the NANOGrav 15-year data implies suppressed Sachs-Wolf (SW) effects in the CGBW spectrum, leading to a marginally negative cross-correlation with the CMB at large scales. This procedure is applicable to signals introduced by different early universe processes and is potentially useful for identifying unique features about anisotropies of CGWB from future space-based interferometers and astrometric measurements."
The future search for low-frequency axions and new physics with the FLASH resonant cavity experiment at Frascati National Laboratories,"David Alesini, Danilo Babusci, Paolo Beltrame, Fabio Bossi, Paolo Ciambrone",2309.00351,physics.ins-det,10.1016/j.dark.2023.101370,3,"We present a proposal for a new experiment, the FINUDA magnet for Light Axion SearcH (FLASH), a large resonant-cavity haloscope in a high static magnetic field which is planned to probe new physics in the form of dark matter (DM) axions, scalar fields, chameleons, hidden photons, as well as high frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Concerning the QCD axion, FLASH will search for these particles as the DM in the mass range (0.49-1.49) ueV, thus filling the mass gap between the ranges covered by other planned searches. A dedicated Microstrip SQUID operating at ultra-cryogenic temperatures will amplify the signal. The frequency range accessible overlaps with the Very High Frequency (VHF) range of the radio wave spectrum and allows for a search in GWs in the frequency range (100-300) MHz. The experiment will make use of the cryogenic plant and magnet of the FINUDA experiment at INFN Frascati National Laboratories near Rome (Italy); the operations needed to restore the functionalities of the apparatus are currently underway. We present the setup of the experiment and the sensitivity forecasts for the detection of axions, scalar fields, chameleons, hidden photons, and GWs."
Graviton detection and the quantization of gravity,"Daniel Carney, Valerie Domcke, Nicholas L. Rodd",2308.12988,hep-th,,3,"We revisit a question asked by Dyson: ""Is a graviton detectable?"" We demonstrate that in both Dyson's original sense and in a more modern measurement-theoretic sense, it is possible to construct a detector sensitive to single gravitons, and in fact a variety of existing and near-term gravitational wave detectors can achieve this. However, while such a signal would be consistent with the quantization of the gravitational field, we draw on results from quantum optics to show how the same signal could just as well be explained via classical gravitational waves. We outline the kind of measurements that would be needed to demonstrate quantization of gravitational radiation and explain why these are substantially more difficult than simply counting graviton clicks or observing gravitational noise in an interferometer, and likely impossible to perform in practice."
The Global Network of Cavities to Search for Gravitational Waves (GravNet): A novel scheme to hunt gravitational waves signatures from the early universe,"Kristof Schmieden, Matthias Schott",2308.11497,gr-qc,,1,"The idea of searching for gravitational waves using cavities in strong magnetic fields has recently received significant attention. Specifically, discussions focus on cavities with relatively small volumes, which are currently employed in the search for axions. In this context, we propose a novel experimental scheme that enables the detection of gravitational waves in the GHz regime, which could originate, for example, from primordial black hole mergers. The scheme is based on synchronous measurements of cavity signals from multiple devices operating in magnetic fields at distant locations. While gravitational wave signatures might be detectable in individual cavities, distinguishing them from noise is highly challenging. By analyzing the correlation among signals from several, possibly geographically separated cavities, it is not only possible to significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio but also to investigate the source of those gravitational wave signatures. In the context of this proposal, a first demonstration experiment with one superconducting cavity is currently conducted, which is the basis of the proposed data-analysis approaches. On this basis the prospects of GravNet (Global Network of Cavities to Search for Gravitational Waves) are outlined in the paper."
Fast radio burstssignalhigh-frequency gravitational waves,"Ashu Kushwaha, Sunil Malik, S. Shankaranarayanan",2311.11150,gr-qc,10.1142/S0218271823420105,0,"There is growing evidence for high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) ranging from MHz to GHz. Several HFGW detectors have been operating for over a decade, and two GHz events have been reported recently. However, a confirmed detection might take a decade. This essay argues that unexplained observed astrophysical phenomena, like Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), might provide indirect evidence for HFGWs. In particular, using the Gertsenshtein-Zel$'$dovich effect, we show that our model can explain three key features of FRBs: generate peak-flux up to $1000~{\rm Jy}$, naturally explain the pulse width and the coherent nature of FRBs. In short, our model offers a novel perspective on the indirection detection of HFGWs beyond current detection capabilities. Thus, transient events like FRBs are a rich source for multi-messenger astronomy."
Relic Gravitational Waves from the Chiral Plasma Instability in the Standard Cosmological Model,"Axel Brandenburg, Emma Clarke, Tina Kahniashvili, Andrew J. Long, Guotong Sun",2307.09385,astro-ph.CO,,0,"In the primordial plasma, at temperatures above the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, the presence of chiral asymmetries is expected to induce the development of helical hypermagnetic fields through the phenomenon of chiral plasma instability. It results in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence due to the high conductivity and low viscosity and sources gravitational waves that survive in the universe today as a stochastic polarized gravitational wave background. In this article, we show that this scenario only relies on Standard Model physics, and therefore the observable signatures, namely the relic magnetic field and gravitational background, are linked to a single parameter controlling the initial chiral asymmetry. We estimate the magnetic field and gravitational wave spectra, and validate these estimates with 3D numerical simulations."
The multi-mode acoustic gravitational wave experiment: MAGE,"William M. Campbell, Maxim Goryachev, Michael E. Tobar",2307.00715,gr-qc,10.1038/s41598-023-35670-y,0,"The Multi-mode Acoustic Gravitational wave Experiment (MAGE) is a high frequency gravitational wave detection experiment. In its first stage, the experiment features two near-identical quartz bulk acoustic wave resonators that act as strain antennas with spectral sensitivity as low as $6.6\times 10^{-21} \left[\textrm{strain}\right]/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in multiple narrow bands across MHz frequencies. MAGE is the successor to the initial path-finding experiments; GEN 1 and GEN 2. These precursor runs demonstrated the successful use of the technology, employing a single quartz gravitational wave detector that found significantly strong and rare transient features. As the next step to this initial experiment, MAGE will employ further systematic rejection strategies by adding an additional quartz detector such that localised strains incident on just a single detector can be identified. The primary goals of MAGE will be to target signatures arising from objects and/or particles beyond that of the standard model, as well as identifying the source of the rare events seen in the predecessor experiment. The experimental set-up, current status and future directions for MAGE are discussed. Calibration procedures of the detector and signal amplification chain are presented. The sensitivity of MAGE to gravitational waves is estimated from knowledge of the quartz resonators. Finally, MAGE is assembled and tested in order to determine the thermal state of its new components."

Quantum decay of scalar and vector boson stars and oscillons into gravitons,"Kazunori Nakayama, Fuminobu Takahashi, Masaki Yamada",2306.12961,hep-ph,10.1088/1475-7516/2023/08/058,1,"We point out that a soliton such as an oscillon or boson star inevitably decays into gravitons through gravitational interactions. These decay processes exist even if there are no apparent self-interactions of the constituent field, scalar or vector, since they are induced by gravitational interactions. Hence, our results provide a strict upper limit on the lifetime of oscillons and boson stars including the dilute axion star. We also calculate the spectrum of the graviton background from decay of solitons."
Macroscopic Dark Matter Detection with Gravitational Wave Experiments,"Yufeng Du, Vincent S.H. Lee, Yikun Wang, Kathryn M. Zurek",2306.13122,astro-ph.CO,,1,"We study signatures of macroscopic dark matter (DM) in current and future gravitational wave (GW) experiments. Transiting DM with a mass of $\sim10^5-10^{15}$ kg that saturates the local DM density can be potentially detectable by GW detectors, depending on the baseline of the detector and the strength of the force mediating the interaction. In the context of laser interferometers, we derive the gauge invariant observable due to a transiting DM, including the Shapiro effect, and adequately account for the finite photon travel time within an interferometer arm. In particular, we find that the Shapiro effect can be dominant for short-baseline interferometers such as Holometer and GQuEST. We also find that proposed experiments such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope can constrain a fifth force between DM and baryons, at the level of strength $\sim 10^3$ times stronger than gravity for, e.g., kg mass DM with a fifth-force range of $10^6$ m."
Competitive effects between gravitational radiation and mass variation for two-body systems in circular orbits,"Baptiste Blachier, Aurélien Barrau, Killian Martineau, Cyril Renevey",2306.09069,gr-qc,,3,"This work provides, at lower order, general analytical solutions for the orbital separation, merging time, and orbital frequency of binary systems emitting gravitational waves while being submitted to mass variations. Specific features, depending on the exponent of the mass derivative, are investigated in details. Two phenomenologically interesting cases are explicitly considered : i) binaries formed by two light primordial black holes submitted to Hawking evaporation and ii) bodies driven by a Bondi accretion of phantom dark energy. It is shown that three different regimes arise, including an intricate non-monotonic behaviour of the system. We study subtle imprints that could be associated with those phenomena. A careful analysis of the conditions of validity of the different hypotheses performed is finally carried out."
Prospects for Direct Detection of Black Hole Formation in Neutron Star Mergers with Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors,"Arnab Dhani, David Radice, Jan Schütte-Engel, Susan Gardner, Bangalore Sathyaprakash",2306.06177,gr-qc,,3,"A direct detection of black hole formation in neutron star mergers would provide invaluable information about matter in neutron star cores and finite temperature effects on the nuclear equation of state. We study black hole formation in neutron star mergers using a set of 196 numerical relativity simulations consisting of long-lived and black hole-forming remnants. The postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum of a long-lived remnant has greatly reduced power at a frequency $f$ greater than $f_{\rm peak}$, for $f \gtrsim 4\,\rm kHz$, with $f_{\rm peak} \in [2.5, 4]\,\rm kHz$. On the other hand, black-hole-forming remnants exhibit excess power in the same large $f$ region and manifest exponential damping in the time domain characteristic of a quasi-normal mode. We demonstrate that the gravitational-wave signal from a collapsed remnant is indeed a quasi-normal ringing. We report on the opportunity for direct detections of black hole formation with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope and set forth the tantalizing prospect of such observations up to a distance of 100 Mpc."
Electromagnetic high-frequency gravitational wave detection,Valerie Domcke,2306.04496,gr-qc,,6,"Ultra-high frequency gravitational waves in the MHz to THz regime promise a unique possibility to probe the very early universe, particle physics at very high energies and exotic astrophysical objects - but achieving the sensitivity required for detection is an immense challenge. This is a brief summary of recent progress in electromagnetic high-frequency gravitational wave searches, which are based on classical electromagnetism in a space-time perturbed by gravitational waves. A particular focus is given to synergies with axion searches and atomic precision measurements. This article was prepared as proceedings for Moriond EW 2023."
Symmetries and Selection Rules: Optimising Axion Haloscopes for Gravitational Wave Searches,"Valerie Domcke, Camilo Garcia-Cely, Sung Mook Lee, Nicholas L. Rodd",2306.03125,hep-ph,,7,"In the presence of electromagnetic fields, both axions and gravitational waves (GWs) induce oscillating magnetic fields: a potentially detectable fingerprint of their presence. We demonstrate that the response is largely dictated by the symmetries of the instruments used to search for it. Focussing on low mass axion haloscopes, we derive selection rules that determine the parametric sensitivity of different detector geometries to axions and GWs, and which further reveal how to optimise the experimental geometry to maximise both signals. The formalism allows us to forecast the optimal sensitivity to GWs in the range of 100 kHz to 100 MHz for instruments such as ABRACADABRA, BASE, ADMX SLIC, SHAFT, WISPLC, and DMRadio."

Bremsstrahlung-induced gravitational waves in monomial potentials during reheating,"Basabendu Barman, Nicolás Bernal, Yong Xu, Óscar Zapata",2305.16388,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.083524,1,"We discuss the production of primordial gravitational waves (GW) from radiative inflaton decay during the period of reheating, assuming perturbative decay of the inflaton either into a pair of bosons or fermions, leading to successful reheating satisfying constraint from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Assuming that the inflaton $\phi$ oscillates in a general monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^n$, which results in a time-dependent inflaton decay width, we show that the resulting stochastic GW background can have optimistic detection prospects, especially in detectors that search for a high-frequency GW spectrum, depending on the choice of $n$ that determines the shape of the potential during reheating. We also discuss how this GW energy density may affect the measurement of $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ for bosonic and fermionic reheating scenarios."
Probing high frequency gravitational waves with pulsars,"Asuka Ito, Kazunori Kohri, Kazunori Nakayama",2305.13984,gr-qc,,8,"We study graviton-photon conversion in magnetosphere of a pulsar and explore the possibility of detecting high frequency gravitational waves with pulsar observations. It is shown that conversion of one polarization mode of photons can be enhanced significantly due to strong magnetic fields around a pulsar. We also constrain stochastic gravitational waves in frequency range of $10^{8}-10^{9}\,$Hz and $10^{13}-10^{27}\,$Hz by using data of observations of the Crab pulsar and the Geminga pulsar. Our method widely fills the gap among existing high frequency gravitational wave experiments and boosts the frequency frontier in gravitational wave observations."
Quantum sensing for particle physics,"Steven D. Bass, Michael Doser",2305.11518,quant-ph,,3,"Quantum sensing is a rapidly growing approach to probe fundamental physics, pushing the frontiers with precision measurements in our quest to understand the deep structure of matter and its interactions. This field uses properties of quantum mechanics in the detectors to go beyond traditional measurement techniques. Key particle physics topics where quantum sensing can play a vital role include neutrino properties, tests of fundamental symmetries (Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle including searches for possible variations in fundamental constants as well as searches for electric dipole moments), the search for dark matter and testing ideas about the nature of dark energy. Interesting new sensor technologies include atom interferometry, optomechanical devices, and atomic and nuclear clocks including with entanglement.This Perspective explores the opportunities for these technologies in future particle physics experiments, opening new windows on the structure of the Universe."

Detecting High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Planetary Magnetosphere,"Tao Liu, Jing Ren, Chen Zhang",2305.01832,hep-ph,,9,"High-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) carry a wealth of information on the early Universe with a tiny comoving Hubble horizon and astronomical objects of small scale but with dense energy. We demonstrate that the nearby planets, such as Earth and Jupiter, can be utilized as a laboratory for detecting the HFGWs. These GWs are then expected to convert to signal photons in the planetary magnetosphere, across the frequency band of astronomical observation. As a proof of concept, we present the first limits from the existing low-Earth-orbit satellite for specific frequency bands and project the sensitivities for the future more-dedicated detections. The first limits from Juno, the latest mission orbiting Jupiter, are also presented. Attributed to the long path of effective GW-photon conversion and the wide angular distribution of signal flux, we find that these limits are highly encouraging, for a broad range of frequencies including a large portion unexplored before."
Novel high-frequency gravitational waves detection with split cavity,"Chu-Tian Gao, Yu Gao, Yiming Liu, Sichun Sun",2305.00877,gr-qc,,2,"Gravitational waves can generate electromagnetic effects inside a strong electric or magnetic field within the Standard Model and general relativity. Here we propose using a quarterly split cavity and LC-resonance circuit to detect a high-frequency gravitational wave from 0.1 MHz to GHz. We perform a full 3D simulation of the cavity's signal for sensitivity estimate. Our sensitivity depends on the coherence time scale of the high-frequency gravitational wave sources and the volume size of the split cavity. We discuss the resonant measurement schemes for narrow-band gravitational wave sources and also a non-resonance scheme for broadband signals. For a meter-sized split cavity under a 14 Tesla magnetic field, the LC resonance enhanced sensitivity to the gravitational wave strain is expected to reach $h\sim 10^{-20}$ around $10$ MHz."
Stochastic gravitational-wave background at 3G detectors as a smoking gun for microscopic dark matter relics,"Gabriele Franciolini, Paolo Pani",2304.13576,astro-ph.CO,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.083527,4,"Microscopic horizonless relics could form in the early universe either directly through gravitational collapse or as stable remnants of the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes. In both cases they completely or partially evade cosmological constraints arising from Hawking evaporation and in certain mass ranges can explain the entirety of the dark matter. We systematically explore the stochastic gravitational-wave background associated with the formation of microscopic dark-matter relics in various scenarios, adopting an agnostic approach and discussing the limitations introduced by existing constraints, possible ways to circumvent the latter, and expected astrophysical foregrounds. Interestingly, this signal is at most marginally detectable with current interferometers but could be detectable by third-generations instruments such as the Einstein Telescope, strengthening their potential as discovery machines."
Searching for stochastic gravitational waves below a nanohertz,"William DeRocco, Jeff A. Dror",2304.13042,astro-ph.HE,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.103011,10,"The stochastic gravitational-wave background is imprinted on the times of arrival of radio pulses from millisecond pulsars. Traditional pulsar timing analyses fit a timing model to each pulsar and search the residuals of the fit for a stationary time correlation. This method breaks down at gravitational-wave frequencies below the inverse observation time of the array; therefore, existing analyses restrict their searches to frequencies above 1 nHz. An effective method to overcome this challenge is to study the correlation of secular drifts of parameters in the pulsar timing model itself. In this paper, we show that timing model correlations are sensitive to sub-nanohertz stochastic gravitational waves and perform a search using existing measurements of pulsar spin-decelerations and pulsar binary orbital decay rates. We do not observe a signal at our present sensitivity, constraining the stochastic gravitational-wave relic energy density to $\Omega_\text{GW} ( f ) < 3.8 \times 10 ^{ - 9} $ at 450~pHz with sensitivity which scales as the frequency squared until approximately 10 pHz. We place additional limits on the amplitude of a power-law spectrum of $A_\star \lesssim 1.8\times10^{-14}$ for a reference frequency of $f_* = 1~{\rm year} ^{-1} $ and the spectral index expected from supermassive black hole binaries, $\gamma = 13/3$. If detection of a supermassive black hole binary signal above 1 nHz is confirmed, this search method will serve as a critical complementary probe of the dynamics of galaxy evolution."
Shimmering gravitons in the gamma-ray sky,"Sabir Ramazanov, Rome Samanta, Georg Trenkler, Federico R. Urban",2304.11222,astro-ph.HE,10.1088/1475-7516/2023/06/019,5,"What is the highest energy at which gravitons can be observed? We address this question by studying graviton-to-photon conversion - the inverse-Gertsenshtein effect - in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We find that above $\sim 1~\mbox{PeV}$ the effective photon mass grows large enough to quench the conversion rate. For sub-PeV energies, the induced photon flux is comparable to the sensitivity of LHAASO to a diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, but only for graviton abundances of order $\Omega_{\text{gw}} h^2_0 \sim 1$. In the future, owing to a better understanding of $\gamma$-ray backgrounds, larger effective areas and longer observation times, sub-PeV shimmering gravitons with a realistic abundance of $\Omega_{\text{gw}} h^2_0 \sim 0.01$ could be detected. We show how such a large abundance is achieved in a cosmologically-motivated scenario of post-recombination superheavy dark matter decay. Therefore, the sub-PeV range might be the ultimate energy frontier at which gravitons can be observed."
High-frequency gravitational wave detection via optical frequency modulation,"Torsten Bringmann, Valerie Domcke, Elina Fuchs, Joachim Kopp",2304.10579,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.L061303,8,"High-frequency gravitational waves can be detected by observing the frequency modulation they impart on photons. We discuss fundamental limitations to this method related to the fact that it is impossible to construct a perfectly rigid detector. We then propose several novel methods to search for O(MHz-GHz) gravitational waves based on the frequency modulation induced in the spectrum of an intense laser beam, by applying optical frequency demodulation techniques, or by using optical atomic clock technology. We find promising sensitivities across a broad frequency range."
The primordial black holes that disappeared: connections to dark matter and MHz-GHz gravitational Waves,"Thomas C. Gehrman, Barmak Shams Es Haghi, Kuver Sinha, Tao Xu",2304.09194,hep-ph,10.1088/1475-7516/2023/10/001,12,"In the post-LIGO era, there has been a lot of focus on primordial black holes (PBHs) heavier than $\sim 10^{15}$g as potential dark matter (DM) candidates. We point out that the branch of the PBH family that disappeared - PBHs lighter than $\sim 10^9$g that ostensibly Hawking evaporated away in the early Universe - also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics, for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs. We compute the strength of such GWs compatible with the observed DM relic density, and find that the GW signal morphology can in principle allow one to distinguish between the two PBH formation histories."
Universal Gravitational Wave Signatures of Cosmological Solitons,"Kaloian D. Lozanov, Misao Sasaki, Volodymyr Takhistov",2304.06709,astro-ph.CO,,9,"Cosmological solitonic objects such as monopoles, cosmic strings, domain walls, oscillons and Q-balls often appear in theories of the early Universe. We demonstrate that such scenarios are generically accompanied by a novel production source of gravitational waves stemming from soliton isocurvature perturbations. The resulting induced universal gravitational waves (UGWs) reside at lower frequencies compared to gravitational waves typically associated with soliton formation. We show that UGWs from axion-like particle (ALP) oscillons, originating from ALP misalignment, extend the frequency range of produced gravitational waves by more than two orders of magnitude regardless of the ALP mass and decay constant and can be observable in upcoming gravitational wave experiments. UGWs open a new route for gravitational wave signatures in broad classes of cosmological theories."
Neutrino signals from Neutron Star implosions to Black Holes,"Yossef Zenati, C. Albertus, M. Ángeles Pérez-García, Joseph Silk",2304.06746,astro-ph.CO,,2,"We calculate the neutrino luminosity in an astrophysical scenario where dark matter is captured by a neutron star which eventually implodes to form a low mass black hole. The Trojan horse scenario involves the collapse of a neutron star (NS) due to the accumulation of a critical amount of dark matter (DM) during its lifetime. As a result, a central disk forms out of the ejected material with a finite radial extension, density, temperature, and lepton fraction, producing fainter neutrino luminosities and colder associated spectra than found in a regular core-collapse supernova. The emitted gravitational wave (GW) signal from the imploding NS should be detectable at ultra-high $\gtrsim 0.1$ GHz frequencies."
Circularly polarized gravitational waves in Chern-Simons gravity originating from an axion domain wall,"Sugumi Kanno, Jiro Soda, Akira Taniguchi",2304.03944,hep-th,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.083525,0,"We study a scattering problem of gravitational waves (GWs) by an axion domain wall in Chern-Simons (CS) gravity. We find that circular polarization of GWs is produced after passing through the domain wall. It turns out that the circular polarization is sizable if the frequency of the GW is comparable to a critical value determined by the characteristic CS length scale and the energy scale of the axion domain wall. Thus, observations of the circular polarization could give a stringent constraint on the characteristic CS length scale or could be a new avenue to search for axion."
Oscillon formation during inflationary preheating with general relativity,"Josu C. Aurrekoetxea, Katy Clough, Francesco Muia",2304.01673,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.023501,8,"We study the non-perturbative evolution of inflationary fluctuations during preheating using fully non-linear general-relativistic field-theory simulations. We choose a single-field inflationary model that is consistent with observational constraints and start the simulations at the end of inflation with fluctuations both in the field and its conjugate momentum. Gravity enhances the growth of density perturbations, which then collapse and virialize, forming long-lived stable oscillon-like stars that reach compactnesses $\mathcal{C}\equiv GM/R \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. We find that $\mathcal{C}$ increases for larger field models, until it peaks due to the interplay between the overdensity growth and Hubble expansion rates. Whilst gravitational effects can play an important role in the formation of compact oscillons during preheating, the objects are unlikely to collapse into primordial black holes without an additional enhancement of the initial inflationary fluctuations."
Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from compact binary coalescenses with resonant cavities,"Aurélien Barrau, Juan García-Bellido, Thierry Grenet, Killian Martineau",2303.06006,gr-qc,,3,"This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely."

String Cosmology: from the Early Universe to Today,"Michele Cicoli, Joseph P. Conlon, Anshuman Maharana, Susha Parameswaran, Fernando Quevedo",2303.04819,hep-th,,49,"We review applications of string theory to cosmology, from primordial times to the present-day accelerated expansion. Starting with a brief overview of cosmology and string compactifications, we discuss in detail moduli stabilisation, inflation in string theory, the impact of string theory on post-inflationary dynamics (reheating, moduli domination, kination), dark energy (the cosmological constant from a string landscape and models of quintessence) and various alternative scenarios (string/brane gases, the pre big-bang scenario, rolling tachyons, ekpyrotic/cyclic cosmologies, bubbles of nothing, S-brane and holographic cosmologies). The state of the art in string constructions is described in each topic and, where relevant, connections to swampland conjectures are made. The possibilities for novel particles and excitations (axions, moduli, cosmic strings, branes, solitons, oscillons and boson stars) are emphasised. Implications for the physics of the CMB, gravitational waves, dark matter and dark radiation are discussed along with potential observational signatures."
Electromagnetic counterparts of high-frequency gravitational waves in a rotating laboratory frame system and their detection,"Fang-Yu Li, Hao Yu, Jin Li, Lian-Fu Wei, Qing-Quan Jiang",2303.03974,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.065014,1,"We consider the perturbative photon flows (PPFs, i.e., electromagnetic (EM) counterparts) generated by the EM resonance response to high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) with additional polarization states in a rotating laboratory frame system. It is found that when the propagating direction of HFGWs and the symmetrical axis of the laboratory frame system are the same, the PPFs have the maximum value. In this case, using the rotation (the rotation of the azimuth $\phi$) of the EM detection system, all six possible polarization states of HFGWs can be separated and displayed. For the current experimental conditions, it is quite prospective to detect the PPFs generated by the HFGWs predicted in the braneworld models, the primordial black hole theories, the interaction mechanism between astrophysical plasma and intense EM radiation, etc., due to the large amplitudes (or high spectral densities) and spectral characteristics of these HFGWs. Detecting the primordial HFGWs from inflation faces great challenges at present, but it is not impossible."
Testing BSM physics with gravitational waves,"Francesco Muia, Fernando Quevedo, Andreas Schachner, Gonzalo Villa",2303.01548,hep-ph,10.1088/1475-7516/2023/09/006,5,"The Cosmic Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) is an irreducible background of gravitational waves generated by particle exchange in the early Universe plasma. Standard Model particles contribute to such a stochastic background with a peak at $f\sim 80$ GHz. Any physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) may modify the CGWB spectrum, making it a potential testing ground for BSM physics. We consider the impact of general BSM scenarios on the CGWB, including an arbitrary number of hidden sectors. We find that the largest amplitude of the CGWB comes from the sector that dominates the energy density after reheating and confirm the dominance of the SM for standard cosmological histories. For non-standard cosmological histories, such as those with a stiff equation of state $\omega >1/3$, like in kination, BSM physics may dominate and modify the spectrum substantially. We conclude that, if the CGWB is detected at lower frequencies and amplitudes compared to that of the SM, it will hint at extra massive degrees of freedom or hidden sectors. If it is instead measured at higher values, it will imply a period with $\omega >1/3$. We argue that for scenarios with periods of kination in the early Universe, a significant fraction of the parameter space can be ruled out from dark radiation bounds at BBN."
Primordial gravitational waves from black hole evaporation in standard and nonstandard cosmologies,"Aurora Ireland, Stefano Profumo, Jordan Scharnhorst",2302.10188,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.107.104021,8,"Gravitons radiated from light, evaporating black holes contribute to the stochastic background of gravitational waves. The spectrum of such emission depends on both the mass and the spin of the black holes, as well as on the redshifting that occurs between the black hole formation and today. This, in turn, depends on the expansion history of the universe, which is largely unknown and unconstrained at times prior to the synthesis of light elements. Here, we explore the features of the stochastic background of gravitational waves from black hole evaporation under a broad range of possible early cosmological histories. The resulting gravitational wave signals typically peak at very high frequencies, and offer opportunities for proposed ultra-high frequency gravitational wave detectors. Lower-frequency peaks are also possible, albeit with a suppressed intensity that is likely well below the threshold of detectability. We find that the largest intensity peaks correspond to cosmologies dominated by fluids with equations of state that have large pressure-to-density ratios. Such scenarios can be constrained on the basis of violation of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds."
Graviton-Photon Conversion in Atoms and the Detection of Gravitons,"Jin Dai, Gui-Rong Liang",2302.07044,gr-qc,,0,"We study graviton-photon conversion in potential ground-based experiments. From graviton to photon transition, we calculate the cross section of graviton-atom interaction in the presence of spherical atomic electric fields; the obtained results hold for graviton energy around 100 keV to 1 GeV, and would be enhanced along the coherent length in extremely high frequencies; thus it gives a chance to catch MeV level gravitons from the universe with current neutrino facilities. From photon to graviton transition, we propose an experiment using entangled photon pairs to count missing photons passing through transverse magnetic tunnel, which could be used to verify the energy quantization of gravitational field."
Gravitational wave from graviton Bremsstrahlung during reheating,"Basabendu Barman, Nicolás Bernal, Yong Xu, Óscar Zapata",2301.11345,hep-ph,10.1088/1475-7516/2023/05/019,6,"We revisit graviton production via Bremsstrahlung from the decay of the inflaton during inflationary reheating. Using two complementary computational techniques, we first show that such 3-body differential decay rates differ from previously reported results in the literature. We then compute the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background that forms during the period of reheating, when the inflaton perturbatively decays with the radiative emission of gravitons. By computing the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in terms of $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, we constrain the resulting GW energy density from BBN and CMB. Finally, we project current and future GW detector sensitivities in probing such a stochastic GW background, which typically peaks in the GHz to THz ballpark, opening up the opportunity to be detected with microwave cavities and space-based GW detectors."
Detection of high-frequency gravitational waves using high-energy pulsed lasers,"Georgios Vacalis, Giacomo Marocco, James Bamber, Robert Bingham, Gianluca Gregori",2301.08163,gr-qc,10.1088/1361-6382/acd517,1,"We propose a new method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) using high-energy pulsed lasers. Through the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, the interaction between a GW and the laser beam results in the creation of an electromagnetic signal. The latter can be detected using single-photon counting techniques. We compute the minimal strain of a detectable GW which only depends on the laser parameters. We find that a resonance occurs in this process when the frequency of the GW is twice the frequency of the laser. With this method, the frequency range $10^{13}-10^{19} $ Hz is explored non-continuously for strains $h \gtrsim 10^{-20}$ for current laser systems and can be extended to $h \gtrsim 10^{-26}$ with future generation facilities."
Superradiance Properties of Light Black Holes and10−1210^{-12}10−12-102110^{21}1021eV Bosons,Caner Ünal,2301.08267,hep-ph,,3,"We derive the minimum spin value for the light black holes, $10^{-33}-1 \; M_\odot$ ($1-10^{33} \; {\rm gr}$), to experience superradiance via scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, corresponding to boson mass range $10^{-12}-10^{21}$ eV. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for very low spin values, ${\tilde a} \sim 10^{-5}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes (BHs) are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe/cover 2-5 orders of magnitude scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2 mass. If superradiance exists, this drives the spin of the BH to almost zero immediately, independent of the BH formation mechanism. In the case that superradiance is not observed due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion decay constant and energy density. We finally discuss briefly the implications on the Standard Model bosons and Higgs self-interaction."
Detecting the heterodyning of gravitational waves,"Jakob Stegmann, Sander M. Vermeulen",2301.02672,gr-qc,,3,"Gravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. We propose to use this effect to detect low-frequency gravitational waves by searching for correlated frequency modulations in a large set of well-resolved gravitational wave signals. We apply our proposed method to the large number of gravitational wave signals from Galactic binary white dwarfs that are expected to be detected with the planned space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. We show that, given current projections for the number and properties of these sources and the sensitivity of the instrument, this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g., $A\simeq10^{-10}$ at a frequency $F\simeq10^{-8}\,\rm Hz$. When using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO, we expect a sensitivity to gravitational waves competitive with that of current Pulsar Timing Arrays. This would allow the detection of gravitational waves from, e.g., super-massive black hole binaries with chirp masses $M_c\gtrsim10^9\,\rm M_\odot$ at a distance $D\simeq10\,\rm Mpc$. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure. This has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum."
A simple derivation of the Gertsenshtein effect,"Andrea Palessandro, Tony Rothman",2301.02072,gr-qc,10.1016/j.dark.2023.101187,7,"As shown by Gertsenshtein in 1961, an external magnetic field can catalyze the mixing of graviton and photon states in a manner analogous to neutrino-flavor oscillations. We first present a straightforward derivation of the mechanism by a method based on unpublished notes of Freeman Dyson. We next extend his method to include boundary conditions and retrieve the results of Boccaletti et al. from 1970. We point out that, although the coupling between the graviton and photon states is extremely weak, the large magnetic fields around neutron stars $\sim 10^{14}$ G make the Gertsenshtein effect a plausible source of gravitons. We also point out that axion-photon mixing, a subject of active current research, is essentially the same process as the Gertsenshtein effect, and so the general mechanism may be of broad astrophysical and cosmological interest."
Using Pulsar Parameter Drifts to Detect Sub-Nanohertz Gravitational Waves,"William DeRocco, Jeff A. Dror",2212.09751,astro-ph.HE,,5,"Gravitational waves with frequencies below 1 nHz are notoriously difficult to detect. With periods exceeding current experimental lifetimes, they induce slow drifts in observables rather than periodic correlations. Observables with well-known intrinsic contributions provide a means to probe this regime. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of using observed pulsar timing parameters to discover such ''ultralow'' frequency gravitational waves, presenting two complementary observables for which the systematic shift induced by ultralow-frequency gravitational waves can be extracted. Using existing data for these parameters, we search the ultralow frequency regime for continuous-wave signals, finding a sensitivity near the expected prediction from supermassive black hole mergers. We do not see an excess in the data, setting a limit on the strain of $ 7.1 \times 10 ^{ - 14} $ at 1 nHz with a sensitivity dropping approximately quadratically with frequency until 10 pHz. Our search method opens a new frequency range for gravitational wave detection and has profound implications for astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics."

In previous papers, we proposed magnon gravitational wave detectors and gave the first limit on GHz gravitational waves by reinterpreting the existing data from axion dark matter experiments. In this paper, we show that the sensitivity can be improved by constructing the detector specific to gravitational waves. In particular, we employ an infinite sum of terms in the expansion of Fermi normal coordinates to probe gravitational waves with a wavelength comparable to the detector size. As a consequence, we obtain sensitivity of around $h_c \sim 10^{-20}$."
Freezing-In Gravitational Waves,"Jacopo Ghiglieri, Jan Schütte-Engel, Enrico Speranza",2211.16513,hep-ph,,13,"The thermal plasma in the early universe produced a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which peaks today in the microwave regime and was dubbed the cosmic gravitational microwave background (CGMB). In previous works only single graviton production processes that contribute to the CGMB have been considered. Here we also investigate graviton pair production processes and show that these can lead to a significant contribution if the maximum temperature of the universe in units of Planck mass divided by the internal coupling in the heat bath is large enough. As the dark matter freeze-in production mechanism is conceptually very similar to the GW production mechanism from the primordial thermal plasma, we refer to the latter as ""GW freeze-in production"". We also show that quantum gravity effects arising in single graviton production are smaller than the leading order result by a factor of the square of the ratio between the maximum temperature and the Planck mass. In our work we explicitly compute the CGMB spectrum within a scalar model with quartic interaction."
Bremsstrahlung high-frequency gravitational wave signatures of high-scale nonthermal leptogenesis,"Anish Ghoshal, Rome Samanta, Graham White",2211.10433,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.108.035019,10,"Inflaton seeds non-thermal leptogenesis by pair producing right-handed neutrinos in the seesaw model. We show that the inevitable graviton bremsstrahlung associated with inflaton decay can be a unique probe of non-thermal leptogenesis. The emitted gravitons contribute to a high-frequency stochastic gravitational waves background with a characteristic fall-off below the peak frequency. Besides leading to a lower bound on the frequency ($f\gtrsim 10^{11}$ Hz), the seesaw-perturbativity condition makes the mechanism sensitive to the lightest neutrino mass. For an inflaton mass close to the Planck scale, the gravitational waves contribute to sizeable dark radiation, which is within the projected sensitivity limits of future experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD."

The connection is through primordial black holes (PBHs): on the one hand, PBHs induce baryogenesis by Hawking evaporating into a species that has baryon number and $CP$ violating decays; on the other, PBHs induce GWs through second order effects when the scalar fluctuations responsible for their formation re-enter the horizon. We describe the interplay of the parameters responsible for successful baryogenesis on the plane of the strain and frequency of the induced GWs, being careful to delineate regimes where PBH domination or washout effects occur. We provide semi-analytic scalings of the GW strain with the baryon number to entropy ratio and other parameters important for baryogenesis. Along the way, we sketch a solution to the dark matter-baryogenesis coincidence problem with two populations of PBHs, which leads to a double-peaked GW signal. Our results underscore the importance of probing the ultra high frequency GW frontier."
Black holes and nilmanifolds: quasinormal modes as the fingerprints of extra dimensions?,"Anna Chrysostomou, Alan Cornell, Aldo Deandrea, Étienne Ligout, Dimitrios Tsimpis",2211.08489,gr-qc,10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11496-w,3,"We investigate whether quasinormal modes (QNMs) can be used in the search for signatures of extra dimensions. To address a gap in the Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) literature, we focus here on higher dimensions characterised by negative Ricci curvature. As a first step, we consider a product space comprised of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole space-time and a three-dimensional nilmanifold (twisted torus); we model the black hole perturbations as a scalar test field. We suggest that the extra-dimensional geometry can be stylised in the QNM effective potential as a squared mass-like term representing the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum. We then compute the corresponding QNM spectrum using three different numerical methods, and determine a possible ``detectability bound"" beyond which KK masses cannot be detected using QNMs."
Single-Photon Signal Sideband Detection for High-Power Michelson Interferometers,Lee McCuller,2211.04016,physics.ins-det,,10,"The Michelson interferometer is a cornerstone of experimental physics. Its applications range from providing first impressions of wave interference in educational settings to probing spacetime at minuscule precision scales. Interferometer precision provides a unique view of the fundamental medium of matter and energy, enabling tests for new physics as well as searches for the gravitational wave signatures of distant astrophysical events. Optical interferometers are typically operated by continuously measuring the power at their output port. Signal perturbations then create sideband fields, forming a beat-note with the fringe light that modulates that power. When operated at a nearly-dark destructive interference fringe, this readout is a form of homodyne detection, with an imprecision set by a ``standard quantum limit'' attributed to shot noise from quantum vacuum fluctuations. The sideband signal fields carry energy which can, alternatively, be directly observed as photons distinct from the source laser. Without signal energy, vacuum does not form sidebands and cannot spuriously create photon counts or shot noise. Thus, counting can offer improved statistics when searching for weak signals when classical backgrounds are below the standard quantum limit. Here, photon counting statistics are described for optical interferometry, relating the two forms of measurement and showing cases where counting greatly outperforms homodyne readout, even with squeezed state quantum enhancement. The most immediate application for photon counting is improving searches of stochastic signals, such as from quantum gravity or from new particle fields. The advantages of counting may extend to wider applications, such as gravitational wave detectors, and the concept of Fisher-information representative spectral density is introduced to motivate further study."

Continuous gravitational wave detection to understand the generation mechanism of fast radio bursts,"Surajit Kalita, Amanda Weltman",2211.00940,astro-ph.HE,10.1093/mnras/stad392,3,"Since the unexpected discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs), researchers have proposed varied theories and models to explain these phenomena. One such model that has recently been developed incorporates the so-called Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect, which states that when gravitational waves traverse a pulsar magnetosphere, a portion of the gravitational radiation is transformed into electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The observed properties of FRBs are consistent with the properties of this EM radiation, implying, remarkably, that the GZ effect can account for both repeating and non-repeating FRBs. If this model is correct, the pulsar's properties should not change over time, and it would continue to emit both EM dipole and gravitational quadrupole radiation for a long period of time. This article targets the gravitational radiation produced by the pulsar mechanism and shows that several proposed gravitational wave detectors can detect these gravitational waves. If such detections are performed in the future from the location of FRBs, it might validate the GZ process for FRB production and potentially rule out several other theories of FRB generation."

It could also lead to possible signatures imprinted in a gravitational wave spectrum. Through this coupling, a rolling inflaton induces an exponential production of the transverse polarizations of the vector field, having a maximum at the end of inflation when the inflaton field velocity is at its maximum. These gauge particles, already parity asymmetric, will source the tensor components of the metric perturbations, leading to the production of parity violating gravitational waves. In this work we examine the vector particle production with an attempt to mimic its backreaction effects on the inflation evolution in the weak coupling regime. Furthermore, we fully integrate the gauge particle amplitudes spectrum during this production epoch, studying the behavior until the end of reheating. Finally, we calculate the gravitational wave spectrum solely relying on the vector mode WKB expansion in its regime of validity."
Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from chirality imbalanced QCD first-order phase transition withPandCPviolation,"Jingdong Shao, Mei Huang",2209.13809,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.107.043011,4,"The chirality imbalance in QCD is spontaneously induced by a repulsive axial-vector interaction from the instanton anti-instanton pairing at high temperature above the chiral phase transition, and vanishes at low temperature. The chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ is in the same magnitude as estimated from the sphaleron transition. Phase transition of the chirality imbalance is always a first-order one in the early universe with $\mathcal {P}$ and $\mathcal {CP}$ violation. The spectra of gravitational waves and the formation of the primordial black holes from this first-order phase transition is investigated in this work, and the effect of a strong magnetic field is also analyzed. The gravitational waves produced by chirality imbalance can be detected by LISA, Taiji and DECIGO, with the peak energy density locating in the range of $10^{-11}$ to $10^{-9}$ and the peak frequencies lying in the range of $10^{-5}$ Hz to $10^{-2}$ Hz. The spectrum with larger axial vector coupling strength and stronger magnetic field has higher peak energy density and lower peak frequency. According to this trend, the gravitational waves spectra might also be able to be detected by SKA, IPTA and EPTA. The Phase transition inverse duration $\beta/H_*$ calculated from the bounce solution is in the order of $10^4$, which is much higher than typical value $10-100$ from electroweak phase transitions. Based on the mechanism of postponement of the false vacuum decay, it is found that the formation of the primordial black hole is not favored because the phase transition completes in an extreme short time due to the large value of $\beta/H_*$ and thus the false vacuum energy density decays sharply."
Searching for Gravitational Waves with CMS,"Kristof Schmieden, Matthias Schott",2209.12024,gr-qc,,1,"The idea of searching for gravitational waves using cavities in strong magnetic fields has recently received significant attention. Most concepts foresee moderate magnetic fields in rather small volumes, similar to those which are currently employed for axion-like particle searches. We propose to use the magnet system of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment after the high luminosity phase of the LHC as a key component for a future detector for gravitational waves in the MHz frequency range. In this paper we briefly discuss a possible cavity concept which can be integrated into CMS and additionally provide a first estimation of its possible sensitivity."
Resonant production of light sterile neutrinos in compact binary merger remnants,"Garðar Sigurðarson, Irene Tamborra, Meng-Ru Wu",2209.07544,astro-ph.HE,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.123030,1,"The existence of eV-mass sterile neutrinos is not ruled out because of persistent experimental anomalies. Upcoming multi-messenger detections of neutron-star merger remnants could provide indirect constraints on the existence of these particles. We explore the active-sterile flavor conversion phenomenology in a two-flavor scenario (1 active + 1 sterile species) as a function of the sterile neutrino mixing parameters, neutrino emission angle from the accretion torus, and temporal evolution of the merger remnant. The torus geometry and the neutron richness of the remnant are responsible for the occurrence of multiple resonant active-sterile conversions. The number of resonances strongly depends on the neutrino emission direction above or inside the remnant torus and leads to large production of sterile neutrinos (and no antineutrinos) in the proximity of the polar axis as well as more sterile antineutrinos than neutrinos in the equatorial region. As the black hole torus evolves in time, the shallower baryon density is responsible for more adiabatic flavor conversion, leading to larger regions of the mass-mixing parameter space being affected by flavor mixing. Our findings imply that the production of sterile states could have indirect implications on the disk cooling rate, its outflows, and related electromagnetic observables which remain to be assessed."
From inflation to black hole mergers and back again: Gravitational-wave data-driven constraints on inflationary scenarios with a first-principle model of primordial black holes across the QCD epoch,"Gabriele Franciolini, Ilia Musco, Paolo Pani, Alfredo Urbano",2209.05959,astro-ph.CO,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.123526,59,"Recent population studies have searched for a subpopulation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the gravitational-wave (GW) events so far detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), in most cases adopting a phenomenological PBH mass distribution. When deriving such population from first principles in the standard scenario, however, the equation of state of the Universe at the time of PBH formation may strongly affect the PBH abundance and mass distribution, which ultimately depend on the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations. Here we improve on previous population studies on several aspects: (i) we adopt state-of-the-art PBH formation models describing the collapse of cosmological perturbations across the QCD epoch; (ii) we perform the first Bayesian multi-population inference on GW data including PBHs and directly using power spectrum parameters instead of phenomenological distributions; (iii) we critically confront the PBH scenario with LVK phenomenological models describing the GWTC-3 catalog both in the neutron-star and in the BH mass ranges, also considering PBHs as subpopulation of the total events. Our results confirm that LVK observations prevent the majority of the dark matter to be in the form of stellar mass PBHs. We find that the best fit PBH model can comprise a small fraction of the total events, in particular it can naturally explain events in the mass gaps. If the lower mass-gap event GW190814 is interpreted as a PBH binary, we predict that LVK should detect up to a few subsolar mergers and one to $\approx 30$ lower mass gap events during the upcoming O4 and O5 runs. Finally, mapping back the best-fit power spectrum into an ultra slow-roll inflationary scenario, we show that the latter predicts detectable PBH mergers in the LVK band, a stochastic GW background detectable by current and future instruments, and may include the entirety of dark matter in asteroid-mass PBHs."
Comparing Instrument Spectral Sensitivity of Dissimilar Electromagnetic Haloscopes to Axion Dark Matter and High Frequency Gravitational Waves,"Michael E. Tobar, Catriona A. Thomson, William M. Campbell, Aaron Quiskamp, Jeremy F. Bourhill",2209.03004,physics.ins-det,10.3390/sym14102165,11,"It is known that haloscopes that search for dark matter axions via the axion-photon anomaly are also sensitive to gravitational radiation through the inverse Gertsenshtein effect. Recently this way of searching for high frequency gravitational waves has gained momentum as it has been shown that the strain sensitivities of such detectors are of the same order of sensitivity to the axion-photon theta angle. Thus, after calculating the sensitivity of a haloscope to an axion signal, we also have calculated the order of magnitude sensitivity to a gravitational wave signal of the same spectral and temporal form. However, it is unlikely that a gravitational wave and an axion signal will be of the same form, since physically the way the signals are generated are completely different. For gravitational wave detection, the spectral strain sensitivity is in units strain per square root Hz, is the natural way to compare the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors due to its independence on the gravitational wave signal. In this work, we introduce a systematic way to calculate the spectral sensitivity of an axion haloscope, so instrument comparison may be achieved independent of signal assumptions and only depends on the axion to signal transduction sensitivity and noise in the instrument. Thus, the calculation of the spectral sensitivity not only allows the comparison of dissimilar axion detectors independent of signal, but also allows us to compare the order of magnitude gravitational wave sensitivity in terms of spectral strain sensitivity, allowing comparisons to standard gravitational wave detectors based on optical interferometers and resonant-mass technology."
The Challenge of Ruling Out Inflation via the Primordial Graviton Background,"Sunny Vagnozzi, Abraham Loeb",2208.14088,astro-ph.CO,10.3847/2041-8213/ac9b0e,20,"Recent debates around the testability of the inflationary paradigm raise the question of how to model-independently discriminate it from competing scenarios. We argue that a detection of the Cosmic Graviton Background (CGB), the relic radiation from gravitons decoupling around the Planck time, would rule out the inflationary paradigm, as realistic inflationary models would dilute the CGB to an unobservable level. The CGB contribution to the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{{\rm eff},g} \approx 0.054$, is well within the reach of next-generation cosmological probes. We argue that detecting the high-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background associated to the CGB will be challenging but potentially feasible. We briefly discuss expectations within alternatives to inflation, focusing on bouncing cosmologies and emergent scenarios."

We consider a $\phi^{2}$ Palatini inflation model in $R^{2}$ gravity and investigate whether this model can overcome some of the problems of the original $\phi^{2}$ chaotic inflation model. We investigate the compatibility of this model with the observed CMB when treated as an effective theory of inflation in quantum gravity by examining the constraints on the model parameters arising due to Planck-suppressed potential corrections and reheating. Additionally, we consider two possible reheating channels and assess their viability in relation to the constraints on the size of the coupling to the $R^{2}$ term. We present an application of the Affleck-Dine mechanism, in which quadratic $B$-violating potential terms generate the asymmetry, with a complex inflaton as the Affleck-Dine field. We derive the $B$ asymmetry generated in the inflaton condensate analytically and numerically. We use the present-day asymmetry to constrain the size of the $B$-violating mass term and derive an upper bound on the inflaton mass in order for the Affleck-Dine dynamics to be compatible with non-minimally coupled inflation in the metric and Palatini formalisms. We demonstrate the existence of a new class of inflatonic Q-balls in a non-minimally coupled Palatini inflation model, through an analytical derivation of the Q-ball equation and numerical confirmation of the existence of solutions, and derive a range of the inflaton mass squared within which the model can inflate and produce Q-balls. We derive analytical estimates of the properties of these Q-balls, explore the effects of curvature, and discuss observational signatures of the model."
Gravitational Waves from Strange Star Core–Crust Oscillation,"Ze-Cheng Zou, Yong-Feng Huang, Xiao-Li Zhang",2207.12053,astro-ph.HE,10.3390/universe8090442,1,"According to the strange quark matter hypothesis, pulsars may actually be strange stars composed of self-bound strange quark matter. The normal matter crust of a strange star, unlike that of a normal neutron star, is supported by a strong electric field. A gap is then presented between the crust and the strange quark core. Therefore, peculiar core-crust oscillation may occur in a strange star, which can produce distinctive gravitational waves. In this paper, the waveforms of such gravitational waves are derived using a rigid model. We find that the gravitational waves are extremely weak and undetectable, even for the next-generation detectors. Therefore, the seismology of a strange star is not affected by the core-crust oscillation. Observers will have to search for other effects to diagnose the existence of the crust."

Assuming that the dark matter halo is in the form of axions, the CS coupling modifies the pattern of the neutrino flavor oscillations at Earth up to a total suppression in some frequency range. At the same time, the SGWB in the halo could stimulate the axion decay into gravitons over a narrow frequency range, leading to a potentially detectable resonance peak in the enhanced SGWB strain. A consistent picture would require these features to potentially show up in neutrino detection from supernovae, gravitational wave detectors, and experiments aimed at the search for axions in the Milky Way halo."

Gravitational waves from current-carrying cosmic strings,"Pierre Auclair, Simone Blasi, Vedran Brdar, Kai Schmitz",2207.03510,astro-ph.CO,10.1088/1475-7516/2023/04/009,9,"Cosmic strings are predicted by many Standard Model extensions involving the cosmological breaking of a symmetry with nontrivial first homotopy group and represent a potential source of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). Present efforts to model the GW signal from cosmic strings are often based on minimal models, such as, eg, the Nambu--Goto action that describes cosmic strings as exactly one-dimensional objects without any internal structure. In order to arrive at more realistic predictions, it is therefore necessary to consider nonminimal models that make an attempt at accounting for the microscopic properties of cosmic strings. With this goal in mind, we derive in this paper the GW spectrum emitted by current-carrying cosmic strings (CCCSs), which may form in a variety of cosmological scenarios. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model, which, in addition to the mean velocity and correlation length of the string network, also describes the evolution of a chiral (light-like) current. As we are able to show, the solutions of the VOS equations imply a temporarily growing fractional cosmic-string energy density, $\Omega_{\rm cs}$. This results in an enhanced GW signal across a broad frequency interval, whose boundaries are determined by the times of generation and decay of cosmic-string currents. Our findings have important implications for GW experiments in the Hz to MHz band and motivate the construction of realistic particle physics models that give rise to large currents on cosmic strings."

We study the linear and non-linear dynamics of preheating with lattice simulations, following the production of GWs through all relevant stages. We find that large couplings lead to SGWBs with a large amplitude today, of the order of $h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}^{(0)} \simeq 5\cdot10^{-9}$. These backgrounds are however peaked at high frequencies $f_{\rm p} \sim 10^6-10^8$ Hz, which makes them undetectable by current/planned GW observatories.

Searching for dark clumps with gravitational-wave detectors,"Sebastian Baum, Michael A. Fedderke, Peter W.

We reexamine the detectability of these clump transits in a variety of current and future GW detectors, operating over a broad range of frequencies. TM accelerations induced by clump transits through the inner Solar System have frequency content around $f \sim \mu$Hz. Some of us [arXiv:2112.11431] recently proposed a GW detection concept with $\mu$Hz sensitivity, based on asteroid-to-asteroid ranging. From the detailed sensitivity projection for this concept, we find both analytically and in simulation that purely gravitational clump-matter interactions would yield one detectable transit every $\sim 20$ yrs, if clumps with mass $m_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^{14} \text{kg}$ saturate the dark-matter (DM) density. Other (proposed) GW detectors using local TMs and operating in higher frequency bands are sensitive to smaller clump masses and have smaller rates of discoverable signals. We also consider the case of clumps endowed with an additional attractive long-range clump-matter fifth force significantly stronger than gravity (but evading known fifth-force constraints). For the $\mu$Hz detector concept, we use simulations to show that, for example, a clump-matter fifth-force $\sim 10^3$ times stronger than gravity with a range of $\sim\text{AU}$ would boost the rate of detectable transits to a few per year for clumps in the mass range $10^{11} \text{kg} \lesssim m_{\text{cl}} \lesssim 10^{14} \text{kg}$, even if they are a $\sim 1$% sub-component of the DM. The ability of $\mu$Hz GW detectors to probe asteroid-mass-scale dark objects that may otherwise be undetectable bolsters the science case for their development."
Resonant electric probe to axionic dark matter,"Junxi Duan, Yu Gao, Chang-Yin Ji, Sichun Sun, Yugui Yao",2206.13543,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.107.015019,5,"The oscillating light axion field is known as wave dark matter.

The cryogenic amplifier noise is the dominant noise source in the proposed detection system. We estimate that the detection system can have a promising sensitivity to axion dark matter with mass below $10^{-6}$ eV. The projected sensitivities improve with the size of the magnetic field, and the electric signal measurement can be potentially sensitive to the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion with $g_{a\gamma} \sim 10^{-16}$ GeV$^{-1}$ around $m_a \sim 10^{-8}$eV, with a multi-meter scale magnetized region.

To maintain meaningful physical interpretations while obtaining a non-relativistic description, we employ the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. Through the analysis of resulting interaction terms and comparison with flat spacetime counterparts, valuable insights into the effects of gravitational waves on the hydrogen atom are gained. Additionally, we explore selection rules governing the coupling between gravitational waves and the atom and utilize first-order perturbation theory to quantify the induced energy shifts and spectral line splitting.

The same $B-L$ symmetry breaking also gives Majorana mass to right-handed neutrinos inside the bubbles, and their out of equilibrium decays can produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We show that the current LIGO-VIRGO limit on stochastic GW background already excludes part of the $B-L$ parameter space, complementary to the collider searches for heavy $Z^{\prime}$ resonances. Moreover, future GW experiments like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can effectively probe the parameter space of leptogenesis over a wide range of the $B-L$ symmetry-breaking scales and gauge coupling values."
Constraints on PBH as dark matter from observations: a review,Marc Oncins,2205.14722,astro-ph.CO,,3,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a fascinating candidate for being the dark matter, albeit one which has been heavily constrained. This review presents an in depth look at those observational constraints, particularly at their nuances and uncertainties. Despite their varied origins, the standard PBH formation path is assumed to be collapse of perturbations after inflation, which should leave signals visible in the CMB at certain scales. Other constraints come from microlensing surveys, which severely limit PBHs as dark matter in the solar to satellite range, but there are diminishing results in regards to lower mass ranges. Gravitational waves signals and PBH evaporation from Hawking radiation also make for useful probes, but the former requires the next generation of experiments before making constraints beyond the solar mass range, and the later is severely limited above $10^{-16} \rm M_{\odot}$. Other dynamical and accretion constraints exist for PBH of large masses. Care also has to be given, as all these constraints can carry different implications coming from differences between monochromatic and extended mass distributions, and their degree of clustering. Beyond all these issues, a window still exists for primordial black holes to be all of the dark matter between $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-11} \rm M_{\odot}$"
Ultralight pion and superheavy baryon dark matter,"Azadeh Maleknejad, Evan McDonough",2205.12983,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.095011,6,"We consider a dark confining gauge theory with millicharged Ultra-Light Pions (ULP) and heavy baryons as dark matter candidates. The model simultaneously realizes the ultra-light (STrongly-interacting Ultralight Millicharged Particle or ""STUMP"") and superheavy (""WIMPzilla"") dark matter paradigms, connected by the confinement scale of the dark QCD. It is a realization of millicharged ULDM, very unlike conventional axions, and exhibits a mass splitting between the charged and neutral pions. ULPs can easily provide the observed density of the dark matter, and be cosmologically stable, for a broad range of dark QCD scales and quark masses. The dark baryons, produced via gravitational particle production or via freeze-in, provide an additional contribution to the dark matter density. Dark matter halos and boson stars in this context are generically an admixture of the three pions and heavy baryons, leading to a diversity of density profiles. That opens up the accessible parameter space of the model compared with the standard millicharged DM scenarios and can be probed by future experiments. We briefly discuss additional interesting phenomenology, such as ULP electrodynamics, and Cosmic ULP Backgrounds."
Gravitational waves from neutrino mass genesis,Pasquale Di Bari,2205.05744,hep-ph,10.22323/1.406.0064,0,"The discovery of gravitational waves opens new opportunities to test BSM physics. In particular, the production of a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves could provide a signature of the generation of the right-right Majorana neutrino mass term necessary, within type-I seesaw mechanism, to explain lightness of neutrinos and their mixing parameters. I will discuss the possibility that such a generation occurs during a strong first order phase transition within Majoron models [1]. As well known, this can indeed produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves. The scale of the phase transition can or cannot coincide with the seesaw scale. In the latter case a low scale phase transition, occurring in the pre-recombination era, might be tested at very low frequencies ($10^{-9}$--$10^{-6}\,{\rm Hz}$). Even though the signal can hardly reproduce the NANOGrac putative signal such new physics at low scale might help ameliorating the tensions in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model (e.g., the Hubble tension). I will also discuss how a phase transition might be responsible for the generation of dark matter in the form of dark neutrinos coupling to the seesaw neutrinos via Higgs induced right handed-right handed neutrino mixing [2]."
Hunt for light primordial black hole dark matter with ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves,"Gabriele Franciolini, Anshuman Maharana, Francesco Muia",2205.02153,astro-ph.CO,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.103520,41,"Light primordial black holes may comprise a dominant fraction of the dark matter in our Universe. This paper critically assesses whether planned and future gravitational wave detectors in the ultra-high-frequency band could constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of sub-solar primordial black holes. Adopting the state-of-the-art description of primordial black hole merger rates, we compare various signals with currently operating and planned detectors. As already noted in the literature, our findings confirm that detecting individual primordial black hole mergers with currently existing and operating proposals remains difficult. Current proposals involving gravitational wave to electromagnetic wave conversion in a static magnetic field and microwave cavities feature a technology gap with respect to the loudest gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes of various orders of magnitude. However, we point out that one recent proposal involving resonant LC circuits represents the best option in terms of individual merger detection prospects in the range $(1\div 100) \, \text{MHz}$. In the same frequency range, we note that alternative setups involving resonant cavities, whose concept is currently under development, might represent a promising technology to detect individual merger events. We also show that a detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced by unresolved binaries is possible only if the theoretical sensitivity of the proposed Gaussian beam detector is achieved. Such a detector, whose feasibility is subject to various caveats, may be able to rule-out some scenarios for asteroidal mass primordial black hole dark matter. We conclude that pursuing dedicated studies and developments of gravitational wave detectors in the ultra-high-frequency band remains motivated and may lead to novel probes on the existence of light primordial black holes."

We consider the dynamics of both scalar fields present in these models: the inflaton and the spectator, as a negative field-space curvature may lead to geometrical destabilization of the spectator. We perform state-of-the-art lattice simulations with a dedicated numerical code optimized for those models. We corroborate earlier findings that the perturbations of the spectator field are much more unstable than the perturbations of the inflaton field, so the dynamics of early stages of preheating is dominated by the evolution of spectator perturbations. We also calculate the spectrum of gravitational waves originating from scalar fluctuations in order to determine if the $\alpha$-attractor T-models can be constrained or even ruled out by present cosmological observations, but not by direct searches of gravitational waves."
The rise of the primordial tensor spectrum from an early scalar-tensor epoch,"Debika Chowdhury, Gianmassimo Tasinato, Ivonne Zavala",2204.10218,gr-qc,10.1088/1475-7516/2022/08/010,6,"Primordial gravitational waves (PGW) produced during inflation span a large range of frequencies, carrying information on the dynamics of the primordial universe. During an early scalar-tensor dominated epoch, the amplitude of the PGW spectrum can be enhanced over a wide range of frequencies. To study this phenomenon, we focus on a class of scalar-tensor theories, well motivated by high energy theories of dark energy and dark matter, where the scalar is conformally and disformally coupled to matter during the early cosmological evolution. For a conformally dominated epoch, the PGW spectrum has a flat step-like shape. More interestingly, a disformally dominated epoch is characterised by a peaked spectrum with a broken power-law profile, with slopes depending on the scalar-tensor theory considered. We introduce a graphical tool, called broken power-law sensitivity curve, as a convenient visual indicator for understanding whether a given broken power-law profile can be detected by GW experiments. We then analyse the GW spectra for a variety of representative conformal and disformal models, discussing their detectability prospects with the Einstein Telescope (ET), Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO), and Big Bang Observer (BBO)."
Enhanced Gravitational Waves from Inflaton Oscillons,"Kaloian D. Lozanov, Volodymyr Takhistov",2204.07152,astro-ph.CO,10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.181002,15,"In broad classes of inflationary models the period of accelerated expansion is followed by fragmentation of the inflaton scalar field into localized, long-lived and massive oscillon excitations. We demonstrate that matter-dominance of oscillons, followed by their rapid decay, significantly enhances the primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. These oscillon-induced GWs, sourced by second-order perturbations, are distinct and could be orders of magnitude lower in frequency than the previously considered GWs associated with oscillon formation. We show that detectable oscillon-induced GW signatures establish direct tests independent from cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) for regions of parameter space of monodromy, logarithmic and pure natural (plateau) potential classes of inflationary models, among others. We demonstrate that oscillon-induced GWs in a model based on pure natural inflation could be directly observable with the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and DECIGO. These signatures offer a new route for probing the underlying inflationary physics."

Scalar induced gravitational waves from warm inflation,"Richa Arya, Arvind Kumar Mishra",2204.02896,astro-ph.CO,10.1016/j.dark.2022.101116,9,"Stochastic gravitational waves can be induced from the primordial curvature perturbations generated during inflation, through scalar-tensor mode coupling at the second order of cosmological perturbation theory. Here we discuss a model of warm inflation in which large curvature perturbations are generated at the small scales because of inflaton dissipation. These overdense perturbations then collapse at later epoch to form primordial black holes, as was studied in our earlier work (Ref. \cite{Arya:2019wck}), and therefore may also act as a source to the second-order tensor perturbations. In this study, we calculate the spectrum of these secondary gravitational waves from our warm inflationary model. We find that our model leads to a generation of scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGW) over a frequency range ($1-10^6$) Hz. Further, we discuss the detection possibilities of these SIGWs, taking in account the sensitivity of different ongoing and future gravitational wave experiments."
Gravity at the tip of the throat,"Bruno Valeixo Bento, Dibya Chakraborty, Susha Parameswaran, Ivonne Zavala",2204.02086,hep-th,10.1007/JHEP09(2022)208,4,"We study the gravitational signatures that arise from compactifying Type IIB supergravity on a compact space containing a Klebanov-Strassler warped throat. After reviewing the dimensional reduction of the 10d graviton and explicitly obtaining the equations of motion for the 4d tensor $h_{\mu\nu}$, vector $h_{\mu n}$ and scalar $h_{mn}$ modes, we find the masses and wavefunctions of the Kaluza-Klein tower of spin-2 states. We explore how the masses and wavefunctions depend on the balance between the strength of the warping and the size of the bulk, and how these relate to the range and strength of the interactions which correct the Newtonian gravitational potential. By computing the modified Newtonian potential for sources on a brane somewhere along the throat, and applying consistency constraints on the Klebanov-Strassler parameters, we obtain predictions for the phenomenological parameter space. In the case of a fully warped throat, and depending on where the brane is along the throat, these predictions are narrow in range and consistent with current observational and experimental constraints. We also begin an exploration of gravitational wave signatures of KK gravitons in warped throats, finding that strong warping can bring the corresponding frequencies down to the windows of current and proposed experiments."
New Horizons: Scalar and Vector Ultralight Dark Matter,"D. Antypas, A. Banerjee, C. Bartram, M. Baryakhtar, J.

Detectable Gravitational Waves from (P)-reheating probes non-thermal Dark Matter,"Anish Ghoshal, Pankaj Saha",2203.14424,hep-ph,,5,"We show that the stochastic Gravitational Waves (GW) signal generated during the (p)reheating era can act as a novel probe of the non-thermal dark matter production in the early Universe. Such scenarios are of utmost interest when no other interaction between the visible and dark sectors is present, therefore having no other detectability prospects. We consider the remnant energy in the coherently oscillating inflaton zeroth mode to contribute as the observed relic dark matter density in the Universe. To fully capture the nonlinear dynamics and the effects of back-reactions during the oscillation, we resort to fully nonlinear lattice simulation with pseudo-spectral methods to eliminate the differencing noises. We investigate for models whose behavior during the reheating era is of quadratic ($m_{\Phi}^2\Phi^2$ type) and find the typical primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB) spectrum from scatterings among highly populated inflaton modes behaving like matter, as expected, during this nonlinear phase. We predict the detectable dark matter mass ranges within the future GW detectors such as BBO, DECIGO, PTA, AION-MAGIS, and CE to be (MeV - TeV) ranges. We conclude that with the current and future GW detectors operating at high frequencies one will be able to probe non-thermal dark matter which is otherwise impossible to test at laboratories and astrophysical searches due to feeble or no interaction among the visible and dark sectors."
"Searches for New Particles, Dark Matter, and Gravitational Waves with SRF Cavities","Asher Berlin, Sergey Belomestnykh, Diego Blas, Daniil Frolov, Anthony J.

Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity technology has seen tremendous progress in the past decades, as a tool for accelerator science. With advances spear-headed by the SQMS center at Fermilab, they are now being brought to the quantum regime becoming a tool in quantum science thanks to the high degree of coherence. The same high quality factor can be leveraged in the search for new physics, including searches for new particles, dark matter, including the QCD axion, and gravitational waves. We survey some of the physics opportunities and the required directions of R&D. Given the already demonstrated integration of SRF cavities in large accelerator systems, this R&D may enable larger scale searches by dedicated experiments."
On the principle of Astrometric Gravitational Wave Antenna,"Mariateresa Crosta, Mario G. Lattanzi, Christophe Le Poncin-Lafitte, Mario Gai, Qi Zhaoxiang",2203.12760,gr-qc,,0,"The direct detection of gravitational waves by ground-based optical interferometers has opened a new window in astronomy. Nevertheless, as these detectors are a combination of two Michelson-Morley like baselines, their sensitivity for determining the incident direction of a gravitational wave is quite weak compared to current high-precision of space astrometry. We therefore present a novel concept for a gravitational wave antenna in space that uses close pairs of point-like sources as natural sensors to record and characterize the very tiny variations in angular separations induced by a passing gravitational wave, thus operating complementarily to linear arm detectors and enabling to gain informations on the gravitational wave incoming direction. Indeed, the proposed astrometric gravitational wave observable builds on methods of relativistic astrometry that can substantially enhance the strength of gravitational wave signals by exploiting to the fullest the telescope optical resolution and, at same time, provide a powerful tool for identifying the direction to the sources that originated the gravitational wave by monitoring close pairs of stars. Furthermore, the use of two local-line-of-sights in a differential formulation avoids issues related to high order modeling of the local (Solar System) background geometry and the need for accurate satellite ephemeris and attitude."

The gravitational influence of light relics leaves imprints in the cosmic microwave background fluctuations, the large-scale structure of the universe and the primordial element abundances. In this paper, we detail the physics of cosmological light relics, and describe how measurements of their relic density and mass serve as probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. A measurement of the light relic density at the precision of upcoming cosmological surveys will point the way toward new physics or severely constrain the range of viable extensions to the Standard Model."

Revealing the cosmic history with gravitational waves,"Andreas Ringwald, Carlos Tamarit",2203.00621,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.063027,16,"The characteristics of the cosmic microwave background provide circumstantial evidence that the hot radiation-dominated epoch in the early universe was preceded by a period of inflationary expansion. Here, we show how a measurement of the stochastic gravitational wave background can reveal the cosmic history and the physical conditions during inflation, subsequent pre- and re-heating, and the beginning of the hot big bang era. This is exemplified with a particularly well-motivated and predictive minimal extension of the Standard Model which is known to provide a complete model for particle physics -- up to the Planck scale, and for cosmology -- back to inflation."
Spectroscopy of particle couplings with gravitational waves,"Daniel G.

Under certain circumstances a sequence of peaks of different amplitude and frequency -- a $stairway$ -- emerges in a SGWB spectrum, with each peak probing a different coupling. The detection of such signature opens the possibility to reconstruct couplings (spectroscopy) of particle species involved in high energy phenomena generating SGWBs. Stairway-like signatures may arise in causally produced backgrounds in the early Universe, e.g. from preheating or first order phase transitions. As a proof of principle we study a preheating scenario with an inflaton $\phi$ coupled to multiple $daughter$ fields $\lbrace \chi_j \rbrace$ with different coupling strengths. As a clear stairway signature is imprinted in the SGWB spectrum, we reconstruct the relevant couplings with various detectors."

We focus on the large number of colors limit, $N_c\rightarrow \infty$, and compute the spectrum of gravitational waves both for infinitely large and infinitesimally small values of the 't Hooft coupling constant $\lambda$. In the $\lambda\rightarrow \infty$ limit we employ the gauge/gravity duality to compute the emission rate via the analysis of Energy-Momentum tensor thermal correlators. In the $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ limit we employ state-of-the-art perturbative analyses to calculate the complete leading order emission rate. By comparing these extreme limits, we bracket the magnitude of the spectrum induced by this source of gravitational waves. Embedding our results in a cosmological evolution model, we find qualitative and quantitative similarities between the strong coupling spectrum and the extrapolation of the perturbative results up to an intermediate value of the coupling, after an appropriate re-scaling of the effective number of degrees of freedom. We comment on how our results can help better understand the contribution of thermalized matter to the stochastic spectrum of gravitational waves."

We discuss this phenomenon with a particular focus on reinterpreting the results of axion haloscopes based on lumped-element detectors, which probe GWs in the 100 kHz-100 MHz range. Measurements from ABRACADABRA and SHAFT already place bounds on GWs, although the present strain sensitivity is weak. However, we demonstrate that the sensitivity scaling with the volume of such instruments is significant - faster than for axions - and so rapid progress will be made in the future. With no modifications, DMRadio-m$^3$ will have a GW strain sensitivity of $h \sim 10^{-20}$ at 200 MHz. A simple modification of the pickup loop used to readout the induced magnetic flux can parametrically enhance the GW sensitivity, particularly at lower frequencies."
Gertsenshtein-Zel′'′dovich effect: A plausible explanation for fast radio bursts?,"Ashu Kushwaha, Sunil Malik, S. Shankaranarayanan",2202.00032,astro-ph.HE,,4,"We present a novel model that may provide an interpretation for a class of non-repeating FRBs -- short ($<1~\rm{s}$), bright ($0.1 - 1000~\rm{Jy}$) bursts of MHz-GHz frequency radio waves. The model has three ingredients -- compact object, a progenitor with effective magnetic field strength around $10^{10}~{\rm Gauss}$, and high frequency (MHz-GHz) gravitational waves (GWs). At resonance, the energy conversion from GWs to electromagnetic waves occurs when GWs pass through the magnetosphere of such compact objects due to the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich effect. This conversion produces bursts of electromagnetic waves in the MHz-GHz range, leading to FRBs. Our model has three key features: (i) predict peak-flux, (ii) can naturally explain the pulse width, and (iii) coherent nature of FRB. We thus conclude that the neutron star/magnetar could be the progenitor of FRBs. Further, our model offers a novel perspective on the indirection detection of GWs at high-frequency beyond detection capabilities. Thus, transient events like FRBs are a rich source for the current era of multi-messenger astronomy."

In this review, we provide an overview of stochastic GW signals, and characterise them based on features of interest such as generation processes and observational properties. We then review the current detection strategies for stochastic backgrounds, offering a ready-to-use manual for stochastic GW searches in real data. In the process, we distinguish between interferometric measurements of GWs, either by ground-based or space-based laser interferometers, and timing-residuals analyses with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). These detection methods have been applied to real data both by the large GW collaborations and smaller research groups, and the most recent and instructive results are reported here.

In this work, we confirm a missing factor $1/2$ in this solution, which was first identified in Ref.~\cite{Pani:2012bp}. The corrected result has strange features that put questions on the power-counting strategy. We solve this problem by adding the next-to-leading order (NLO) contribution. Compared to the numerical results, the NLO solution reduces the percentage error of the LO solution by a factor of 2 for all important values of $r_g \mu$. Especially the percentage error is $\lesssim 10\%$ in the region of $r_g\mu \lesssim 0.35$. The NLO solution also has a compact form and could be used straightforwardly."

The friction felt by $\varphi$ is then increased by non-Abelian ""strong sphalerons"", leading to a self-amplifying process that can efficiently heat up the medium. We determine a lower bound for the gravitational wave production rate from such a process, originating via hydrodynamic fluctuations and particle collisions, in terms of a minimal number of parameters. Only a moderate fraction of energy density is converted to gravitational waves, suggesting that non-Abelian models may avoid the overproduction observed in some Abelian cases."
Spinodal Gravitational Waves,"Yago Bea, Jorge Casalderrey-Solana, Thanasis Giannakopoulos, Aron Jansen, Sven Krippendorf",2112.15478,hep-th,,12,"We uncover a new gravitational-wave production mechanism in cosmological, first-order, thermal phase transitions. These are usually assumed to proceed via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase. However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble nucleation. We discuss the possibility that the spinodal dynamics may be preceded by a period of thermal inflation."
Gravitational shine of dark domain walls,"E. Babichev, D. Gorbunov, S. Ramazanov, A.

This setup can be realized, if the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking is induced dynamically through the interaction with hot primordial plasma. In that case, the domain wall tension can attain large values in the early Universe without any conflict with observations. Owing to the large initial tension, these topological defects may serve as a powerful source of gravitational waves. We make a preliminary estimate of the gravitational wave spectrum and argue that it is distinct from the spectrum produced by other sources, in particular by domain walls of a constant tension. The resulting gravitational wave signal is in the range accessible by Einstein Telescope, DECIGO, TianQin, LISA, IPTA, or SKA, if the field constituting the domain walls is very feebly coupled with hot primordial plasma and has tiny self-interactions. In particular, one can consider this field for the role of Dark Matter. We discuss various Dark Matter production mechanisms and properties of the emitted gravitational waves associated with them. We find that the conventional freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms lead to large and perhaps unobservable frequency of gravitational waves. However, the Dark Matter production is also possible at the second order phase transition leading to the domain wall formation or at the inverse phase transition, when the domain walls get dissolved eventually. In both cases, there is essentially no lower bound on the frequency of emitted gravitational waves."
Scalar field couplings to quadratic curvature and decay into gravitons,"Yohei Ema, Kyohei Mukaida, Kazunori Nakayama",2112.12774,hep-ph,10.1007/JHEP05(2022)087,8,"Any field, even if it lives in a completely hidden sector, interacts with the visible sector at least via the gravitational interaction. In this paper, we show that a scalar field in such a hidden sector generically couples to the quadratic curvature via dimension five operators, i.e., $\phi R^2$, $\phi R^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}$, $\phi R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, $\phi R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \tilde R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, because they can emerge if there exist particles heavier than it. We derive these scalar couplings to the quadratic curvature by integrating out heavy particles in a systematic manner. Such couplings are of phenomenological interest since some of them induce the scalar decay into the graviton pair. We point out that the decay of a scalar field can produce a substantial amount of the stochastic cosmic graviton background at high frequency since the suppression scale of these operators is given by the mass of heavy particles not by the Planck scale. The resultant graviton spectrum is computed in some concrete models."

We present here a comprehensive overview of this appealing paradigm, highlighting its key ingredients and keeping a reasonable and homogeneous level of details. After summarizing the cosmological evolution in a simple canonical case, we discuss how quintessential inflation can be embedded in a more general scalar-tensor formulation and its relation to variable gravity scenarios. Particular emphasis is placed on the role played by symmetries. In particular, we discuss the evolution of the cosmon field in terms of ultraviolet and infrared fixed points potentially appearing in quantum gravity formulations and leading to the emergence of scale invariance in the early and late Universe. The second part of the review is devoted to the exploration of the phenomenological consequences of the paradigm. First, we discuss how direct couplings of the cosmon field to matter may affect neutrinos masses and primordial structure formation. Second, we describe how Ricci-mediated couplings to spectator fields can trigger the spontaneous symmetry breaking of internal symmetries such as, but not limited to, global U(1) or $Z_2$ symmetries, and affect a large variety of physical processes in the early Universe."

We show that a wide variety of environmental perturbations are small enough to enable an appropriate class of $\sim 10$ km-diameter asteroids to be employed as TMs. This would allow a sensitive GW detector in the band $\text{(few)} \times 10^{-7} \text{Hz} \lesssim f_{\text{GW}} \lesssim \text{(few)} \times 10^{-5} \text{Hz}$, reaching strain $h_c \sim 10^{-19}$ around $f_{\text{GW}} \sim 10 \mu$Hz, sufficient to detect a wide variety of sources. To exploit these asteroid TMs, human-engineered base stations could be deployed on multiple asteroids, each equipped with an electromagnetic transmitter/receiver to permit measurement of variations in the distance between them. We discuss a potential conceptual design with two base stations, each with a space-qualified optical atomic clock measuring the round-trip electromagnetic pulse travel time via laser ranging. Tradespace exists to optimize multiple aspects of this mission: for example, using a radio-ranging or interferometric link system instead of laser ranging. This motivates future dedicated technical design study. This mission concept holds exceptional promise for accessing this GW frequency band."
A faster growth of perturbations in an early matter dominated epoch: primordial black holes and gravitational waves,"Subinoy Das, Anshuman Maharana, Francesco Muia",2112.11486,astro-ph.CO,10.1093/mnras/stac1620,5,"We present a scenario for fast growth of cosmological perturbations; $\delta(t) \sim a(t)^s$, $a(t)$ being the scale factor, with $s > 10$ for the numerical examples reported in this article. The basic ingredients of the scenario are an early matter dominated era and the dark fermion which experiences a scalar mediated force during the epoch. Both of these arise in string/supergravity models. The fast growth occurs for sub-horizon density perturbations of the dark fermion. The fast growth has a rich set of phenomenological implications. We outline implications for the formation of primordial black holes and the production of gravitational waves. Primordial black holes in the sub-lunar mass range (which are ideal dark matter candidates) can be produced. Gravitational waves can be produced in a wide range of frequencies due to second order scalar perturbations and due to evaporation and merger of primordial black holes."
Detecting high-frequency gravitational waves with microwave cavities,"Asher Berlin, Diego Blas, Raffaele Tito D'Agnolo, Sebastian A.R. Ellis, Roni Harnik",2112.11465,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.105.116011,75,"We give a detailed treatment of electromagnetic signals generated by gravitational waves (GWs) in resonant cavity experiments. Our investigation corrects and builds upon previous studies by carefully accounting for the gauge dependence of relevant quantities. We work in a preferred frame for the laboratory, the proper detector frame, and show how to resum short-wavelength effects to provide analytic results that are exact for GWs of arbitrary wavelength. This formalism allows us to firmly establish that, contrary to previous claims, cavity experiments designed for the detection of axion dark matter only need to reanalyze existing data to search for high-frequency GWs with strains as small as $h\sim 10^{-22}-10^{-21}$. We also argue that directional detection is possible in principle using readout of multiple cavity modes. Further improvements in sensitivity are expected with cutting-edge advances in superconducting cavity technology."
Q-balls in nonminimally coupled Palatini inflation and their implications for cosmology,"A.K. Lloyd-Stubbs, J. McDonald",2112.09121,hep-th,10.1103/PhysRevD.105.103532,2,"We demonstrate the existence of Q-balls in non-minimally coupled inflation models with a complex inflaton in the Palatini formulation of gravity. We show that there exist Q-ball solutions which are compatible with inflation and we derive a window in the inflaton mass squared for which this is the case. In particular, we confirm the existence of Q-ball solutions with $\phi \sim 10^{17}-10^{18}$ GeV, consistent with the range of field values following the end of slow-roll Palatini inflation. We study the Q-balls and their properties both numerically and in an analytical approximation. The existence of such Q-balls suggests that the complex inflaton condensate can fragment into Q-balls, and that there may be an analogous process for the case of a real inflaton with fragmentation to neutral oscillons. We discuss the possible post-inflationary cosmology following the formation of Q-balls, including an early Q-ball matter domination (eMD) period and the effects of this on the reheating dynamics of the model, gravitational wave signatures which may be detectable in future experiments, and the possibility that Q-balls could lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). In particular, we show that Palatini Q-balls with field strengths typical of inflaton condensate fragmentation can directly form black holes with masses around 500 kg or more when the self-coupling is $\lambda = 0.1$, resulting in very low (less than 100 GeV) reheating temperatures from black hole decay, with smaller black hole masses and larger reheating temperatures possible for smaller values of $\lambda$. Q-ball dark matter from non-minimally coupled Palatini inflation may also be a direction for future work."
Binary collisions of dark matter blobs,"Melissa D. Diamond, David E.

Sufficiently dense dark objects will dominantly collide through binary mergers instead of random collisions. We detail how one would estimate the merger rate accounting for finite size effects, multibody interactions, and friction with the thermal bath. We predict how mergers of dark dense objects could be detected through gravitational and electromagnetic signals, noting that such mergers could be a unique source of high frequency gravitational waves. We rule out objects whose presence would contradict observations of the CMB and diffuse gamma-rays."
Revisiting small-scale fluctuations in α-attractor models of inflation,"Laura Iacconi, Hooshyar Assadullahi, Matteo Fasiello, David Wands",2112.05092,astro-ph.CO,10.1088/1475-7516/2022/06/007,46,"Cosmological $\alpha$-attractors stand out as particularly compelling models to describe inflation in the very early universe, naturally meeting tight observational bounds from cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We investigate $\alpha$-attractor potentials in the presence of an inflection point, leading to enhanced curvature perturbations on small scales. We study both single- and multi-field models, driven by scalar fields living on a hyperbolic field space. In the single-field case, ultra-slow-roll dynamics at the inflection point is responsible for the growth of the power spectrum, while in the multi-field set-up we study the effect of geometrical destabilisation and non geodesic motion in field space. The two mechanisms can in principle be distinguished through the spectral shape of the resulting scalar power spectrum on small scales. These enhanced scalar perturbations can lead to primordial black hole (PBH) production and second-order gravitational wave (GW) generation. Due to the existence of universal predictions in $\alpha$-attractors, consistency with current CMB constraints on the large-scale spectral tilt implies that PBHs can only be produced with masses smaller than $10^8\,\text{g}$ and are accompanied by ultra-high frequency GWs, with a peak expected to be at frequencies of order $10\,\text{kHz}$ or above."
"GUTs, hybrid topological defects, and gravitational waves","David I. Dunsky, Anish Ghoshal, Hitoshi Murayama, Yuki Sakakihara, Graham White",2111.08750,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.075030,47,"The symmetry breaking of grand unified gauge groups in the early Universe often leaves behind relic topological defects such as cosmic strings, domain walls, or monopoles. For some symmetry breaking chains, hybrid defects can form where cosmic strings attach to domain walls or monopoles attach to strings. In general, such hybrid defects are unstable, with one defect ""eating"" the other via the conversion of its rest mass into the other's kinetic energy and subsequently decaying via gravitational waves. In this work, we determine the gravitational wave spectrum from 1) the destruction of a cosmic string network by the nucleation of monopoles which cut up and ""eat"" the strings, 2) the collapse and decay of a monopole-string network by strings that ""eat"" the monopoles, 3) the destruction of a domain wall network by the nucleation of string-bounded holes on the wall that expand and ""eat"" the wall, and 4) the collapse and decay of a string-bounded wall network by walls that ""eat"" the strings. We call the gravitational wave signals produced from the ""eating"" of one topological defect by another gravitational wave gastronomy. We find that the four gravitational wave gastronomy signals considered yield unique spectra that can be used to narrow down the SO(10) symmetry breaking chain to the Standard Model and the scales of symmetry breaking associated with the consumed topological defects. Moreover, the systems we consider are unlikely to have a residual monopole or domain wall problem."
Kination cosmology from scalar fields and gravitational-wave signatures,"Yann Gouttenoire, Geraldine Servant, Peera Simakachorn",2111.01150,hep-ph,,58,"Kination denotes an era in the cosmological history corresponding to an equation of state $\omega=+1$ such that the total energy density of the universe redshifts as the sixth inverse power of the scale factor. This arises if the universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field. It has often been motivated in the literature as an era following inflation, taking place before the radiation era. In this paper, we review instead the possibility that kination is disconnected from primordial inflation and occurs much later, inside the Standard Model radiation era. We study the implications on all main sources of primordial gravitational waves. We show how this leads to very distinctive peaked spectra in the stochastic background of long-lasting cosmological sources of gravitational waves, namely the irreducible gravitational waves from inflation, and gravitational waves from cosmic strings, both local and global, with promising observational prospects. We present model-independent signatures and detectability predictions at SKA, LIGO, LISA, ET, CE, BBO, as a function of the energy scale and duration of the kination era. We then argue that such intermediate kination era is in fact symptomatic in a large class of axion models. We analyse in details the scalar field dynamics, the working conditions and constraints in the underlying models. We present the gravitational-wave predictions as a function of particle physics parameters. We derive the general relation between the gravitational-wave signal and the axion dark matter abundance as well as the baryon asymmetry. We investigate the predictions for the special case of the QCD axion. The key message is that gravitational-waves of primordial origin represent an alternative experimental probe of axion models."
Gravitational collapse in the postinflationary Universe,"Benedikt Eggemeier, Bodo Schwabe, Jens C.

In particular, the inflaton field can collapse into inflaton halos, forming ""large scale"" structure in the very early universe. We combine N-body simulations with high-resolution zoom-in regions in which the non-relativistic Schr\""odinger-Poisson equations are used to resolve the detailed, wave-like structure of inflaton halos. Solitonic cores form inside them, matching structure formation simulations with axion-like particles in the late-time universe. We denote these objects \textit{inflaton stars}, by analogy with boson stars. Based on a semi-analytic formalism we compute their overall mass distribution which shows that some regions will reach overdensities of $10^{15}$ if the early matter-dominated epoch lasts for 20 $e$-folds. The radii of the most massive inflaton stars can shrink below the Schwarzschild radius, suggesting that they could form primordial black holes prior to thermalization."
Exact model for evaporating primordial black holes in a cosmological spacetime,"Semin Xavier, Alan Sunny, S. Shankaranarayanan",2110.14379,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.105.104038,5,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{17} - 10^{23}~{\rm gm}$ are considered as possible dark matter candidates as they are not subject to big-bang nucleosynthesis constraints and behave like cold dark matter. If PBHs are indeed dark matter, they cannot be treated as isolated objects in asymptotic flat space-time. Furthermore, when compared to stellar-mass black holes, the rate at which the Hawking particles radiate out from PBHs is significantly faster. In this work, we obtain an exact time-dependent solution that models evaporating black holes in the cosmological background. As a result, the solution considers all three aspects of PBHs -- mass-loss due to Hawking radiation, black hole surrounded by mass distribution, and cosmological background. Furthermore, our model predicts that the decay of PBHs occurs faster for larger masses; however, \emph{the decay rate reduces for lower mass}. Finally, we discuss the implications of theoretical constraints on PBHs as dark matter."
Did Goryachev et al. detect megahertz gravitational waves?,"Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane",2110.13319,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.103017,5,"Goryachev et al. [1] recently announced the detection of ""two strongly significant events"" in their Bulk Acoustic Wave High Frequency Gravitational Wave Antenna. They claim many possibilities for the cause of these events, including high-frequency megahertz gravitational waves. We demonstrate these events are not due to gravitational waves for two reasons. 1) The inferred stochastic gravitational-wave background from these events implies the gravitational-wave energy density of the Universe is $\Omega_{\rm gw}\approx 10^8$, approximately $10^8$ times the closure density of the Universe. 2) The low-frequency gravitational-wave memory signal that accompanies any high-frequency gravitational-wave source visible by the current generation of high-frequency detectors would have been visible by LIGO/Virgo as a transient burst with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim10^6$. The non-detection of such loud memory bursts throughout the operation of LIGO/Virgo rules out the gravitational-wave explanation for the high-frequency events detected by Goryachev et al. We discuss broader implications of this work for the ongoing experimental search for ultra high-frequency (MHz-GHz) gravitational waves."

Constraints on planetary and asteroid-mass primordial black holes from continuous gravitational-wave searches,"Andrew L. Miller, Nancy Aggarwal, Sébastien Clesse, Federico De Lillo",2110.06188,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.105.062008,21,"We present new constraints on the merging rates of planetary-mass and asteroid-mass primordial black hole binaries using limits on continuous waves(quasi-monochromatic, quasi-infinite duration signals) derived from an all-sky search for isolated compact objects in the first six months of the third observing run (O3a) of LIGO/Virgo. We calculate the merging rates of these binaries in a model-independent way, and convert them to constraints on the primordial black hole abundance with minimal modelling assumptions. Our results show that we are sensitive to sources at most $\mathcal{O}(10$ pc) away for systems with chirp masses of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}M_\odot)$ at gravitational-wave frequencies around 30-40 Hz. These results also show that continuous-wave searches could in the future directly probe the existence of planetary-mass and asteroid-mass primordial black holes, especially those in binaries with asymmetric mass ratios. Furthermore, they demonstrate that new methods accounting for the full nonlinear gravitational-wave frequency evolution are needed to improve constraints on primordial black holes."
Bubble correlation in first-order phase transitions,"Valerio De Luca, Gabriele Franciolini, Antonio Riotto",2110.04229,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.123539,11,"Making use of both the stochastic approach to the tunneling phenomenon and the threshold statistics, we offer a simple argument to show that critical bubbles may be correlated in first-order phase transitions and biased compared to the underlying scalar field spatial distribution.

We briefly discuss possible implications of this result, e.g. the formation of primordial black holes through bubble collisions."
Were recently reported MHz events planet mass primordial black hole mergers?,Guillem Domènech,2110.00550,astro-ph.CO,10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09853-8,6,"A bulk acoustic wave cavity as high frequency gravitational wave antenna has recently detected two rare events at $5.5$MHz. Assuming that the detected events are due to gravitational waves, their characteristic strain amplitude lies at about $h_c\approx 2.5 \times 10^{-16}$. While a cosmological signal is out of the picture due to the large energy carried by the high frequency waves, the signal could be due to the merging of two planet mass primordial black holes ($\approx 4\times 10^{-4} M_\odot$) inside the Oort cloud at roughly $0.025$ pc ($5300$ AU) away. In this short note, we show that the probability of one such event to occur within this volume per year is around $1:10^{24}$, if such Saturn-like mass primordial black holes are $1\%$ of the dark matter. Thus, the detected signal is very unlikely to be due the merger of planet mass primordial black holes. Nevertheless, the stochastic background of saturn mass primordial black holes binaries might be seen by next generation gravitational wave detectors, such as DECIGO and BBO."
The stochastic gravitational wave background from close hyperbolic encounters of primordial black holes in dense clusters,"Juan García-Bellido, Santiago Jaraba, Sachiko Kuroyanagi",2109.11376,gr-qc,10.1016/j.dark.2022.101009,22,"The inner part of dense clusters of primordial black holes is an active environment where multiple scattering processes take place. Some of them give rise from time to time to bounded pairs, and the rest ends up with a single scattering event. The former eventually evolves to a binary black hole (BBH) emitting periodic gravitational waves (GWs), while the latter with a short distance, called close hyperbolic encounters (CHE), emits a strong GW burst. We make the first calculation of the stochastic GW background originating from unresolved CHE sources. Unlike the case for BBH, the low-frequency tail of the SGWB from CHE is sensitive to the redshift dependence of the event rate, which could help distinguish the astrophysical from the primordial black hole contributions. We find that there is a chance that CHE can be tested by third-generation ground-based GW detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer."

Revealing the Primordial Irreducible Inflationary Gravitational-Wave Background with a Spinning Peccei-Quinn Axion,"Yann Gouttenoire, Géraldine Servant, Peera Simakachorn",2108.10328,hep-ph,,27,"The primordial irreducible gravitational-wave background due to quantum vacuum tensor fluctuations produced during inflation spans a large range of frequencies with an almost scale-invariant spectrum but is too low to be detected by the next generation of gravitational-wave interferometers. We show how this signal is enhanced by a short temporary kination era in the cosmological history (less than 10 e-folds), that can arise at any energy scale between a GeV and the inflationary scale $10^{16}$ GeV. We argue that such kination era is naturally generated by a spinning axion before it gets trapped by its potential. It is usually assumed that the axion starts oscillating around its minimum from its initially frozen position. However, the early dynamics of the Peccei-Quinn field can induce a large kinetic energy in the axion field, triggering a kination era, either before or after the axion acquires its mass, leading to a characteristic peak in the primordial gravitational-wave background. This represents a smoking-gun signature of axion physics as no other scalar field dynamics is expected to trigger such a sequence of equations of state in the early universe. We derive the resulting gravitational-wave spectrum, and present the parameter space that leads to such a signal as well as the detectability prospects, in particular at LISA, Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and Big Bang Observer. We show both model-independent predictions and present as well results for two specific well-motivated UV completions for the QCD axion dark matter where this dynamics is built-in."
Strongly magnetized hot QCD matter and stochastic gravitational wave background,"Mohsen Khodadi, Ujjal Kumar Dey, Gaetano Lambiase",2108.09320,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.063039,7,"The first-order phase transitions in the early Universe are one of the well-known sources which release the stochastic background of gravitational waves. In this paper, we study the contribution of an external static and strong magnetic field on the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs) expected during QCD phase transition. In the light of the strongly magnetized hot QCD equation of state which deviated from the ideal gas up to the one-loop approximation, we estimate two phenomenologically important quantities: peak frequency redshifted to today ($f_{\rm peak}$) and GW strain amplitude ($h^2 \Omega_{gw}$). The trace anomaly induced by the magnetized hot QCD matter around the phase transition generates the stochastic background of GW with peak frequencies lower than the ideal gas-based signal (around nHz). Instead, the strain amplitudes corresponding to the peak frequencies are of the same order of magnitude of the expected signal from ideal gas. This may be promising in the sense that although the strong magnetic field could mask the expected stochastic background of GWs by upgrading the frequency sensitivity of detectors in the future, the magnetized GW is expected to be identified. Faced with the projected reach of detectors EPTA, IPTA, and SKA, we find that for the tail of the magnetized GW signals there remains a mild possibility of detection as it can reach the projected sensitivity of SKA."
Control and measurement of electric dipole moments in levitated optomechanics,"Gadi Afek, Fernando Monteiro, Benjamin Siegel, Jiaxiang Wang, Sarah Dickson",2108.04406,physics.optics,10.1103/PhysRevA.104.053512,8,"Levitated optomechanical systems are rapidly becoming leading tools for precision sensing, enabling a high level of control over the sensor's center of mass motion, rotation and electric charge state. Higher-order multipole moments in the charge distribution, however, remain a major source of backgrounds. By applying controlled precessive torques to the dipole moment of a levitated microsphere in vacuum, we demonstrate cancellation of dipole-induced backgrounds by 2 orders of magnitude. We measure the dipole moments of ng-mass spheres and determine their scaling with sphere size, finding that the dominant torques arise from induced dipole moments related to dielectric-loss properties of the SiO$_2$ spheres. Control of multipole moments in the charge distribution of levitated sensors is a key requirement to sufficiently reduce background sources in future applications."

The events of PT should not be less than $200$, which results in the free parameter $n\geq404$. Under the latest CMB restrictions, we found that the inflation energy is fixed at $10^{15} \rm{GeV}$. Then, we deeply discussed the corresponding stochastic background of the primordial gravitational wave (GW) during inflation. We study the two kinds of $n$ cases, i.e., $n=404, 2000$. We observe that the magnitude of $n$ is negligible for the physical observations, such as $n_s$, $r$, $\Lambda$, and $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}h^2$. In the low-frequency regions, the GW is dominated by the quantum fluctuations, and this GW can be detected by Decigo at $10^{-1}~\rm{Hz}$.

To facilitate the broadband detection of continuous gravitational waves, we tune the kilohertz-scale mechanical resonance frequencies up to 173 Hz/bar by pressurizing the helium.

Baryogenesis via relativistic bubble expansion,"Iason Baldes, Simone Blasi, Alberto Mariotti, Alexander Sevrin, Kevin Turbang",2106.15602,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.115029,30,"We present a novel baryogenesis mechanism in which the asymmetry is sourced from heavy particles which either gain their mass or are created during bubble expansion in a strong first order phase transition. These particles then decay in a CP and baryon number violating way inside the bubble. The particles are inherently out-of-equilibrium and sufficiently dilute after wall crossing so the third Sakharov condition is easily met. Washout is avoided provided the reheat temperature is sufficiently below the scale of the heavy particles. The mechanism relies on moderate supercooling and relativistic walls which -- in contrast to electroweak baryogenesis -- generically leads to a sizable gravitational wave signal, although in the simplest realisations at frequencies beyond upcoming detectors. We present a simple example model and discuss the restrictions on the parameter space for the mechanism to be successful. We find that high reheat temperatures $T_{\rm RH} \gtrsim 10^{10}$ GeV are generally preferred, whereas stronger supercooling allows for temperatures as low as $T_{\rm RH} \sim 10^{6}$ GeV, provided the vacuum energy density is sufficiently suppressed. We briefly comment on using resonantly enhanced CP violation to achieve even lower scales."

The GW-Toolbox is an easy-to-use, flexible tool to simulate observations on the GW universe with different detectors, including ground-based interferometers (advanced LIGO, advanced VIRGO, KAGRA, Einstein Telescope, and also customised designs), space-borne interferometers (LISA and a customised design), pulsar timing arrays mimicking the current working ones (EPTA, PPTA, NANOGrav, IPTA) and future ones. We include a broad range of sources such as mergers of stellar mass compact objects, namely black holes, neutron stars and black hole-neutron stars; and supermassive black hole binaries mergers and inspirals, Galactic double white dwarfs in ultra-compact orbit, extreme mass ratio inspirals and Stochastic GW backgrounds.   Methods. We collect methods to simulate source populations and determine their detectability with the various detectors.

Universal 1020  Hz stochastic gravitational waves from photon spheres of black holes,"Kaishu Saito, Jiro Soda, Hirotaka Yoshino",2106.05552,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.063040,7,"We show that photon spheres of supermassive black holes generate high-frequency stochastic gravitational waves through the photon-graviton conversion.

It turns out that the density parameter of the stochastic gravitational waves $ \Omega_{ \text{gw}}$ could be $ 10^{-12}$.

Detectable Gravitational Wave Signals from Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis,"Graham White, Lauren Pearce, Daniel Vagie, Alexander Kusenko",2105.11655,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.181601,25,"In Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe is generated through the evolution of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a scalar condensate. This scalar condensate generically fragments into non-topological solitons (Q-balls). If they are sufficiently long-lived, they lead to an early matter domination epoch, which enhances the primordial gravitational wave signal for modes that enter the horizon during this epoch. The sudden decay of the Q-balls into fermions results in a rapid transition from matter to radiation domination, producing a sharp peak in the gravitational wave power spectrum. Avoiding the problem of gravitino over-abundance favours scenarios where the peak frequency of the resonance is within the range of the Einstein Telescope and/or Decigo. Therefore, we show this scenario provides an observable signal, providing a mechanism to test Affleck-Dine baryogenesis."

We study this effect in a variant of the Warm Little Inflaton model, where the inflaton couples to light scalars, with a quartic chaotic potential. These large fluctuations on re-entry will form light, evaporating Primordial Black Holes, with masses lighter than $10^6$ g. But at the same time they will act as a source for the tensors at second order. The enhancement is maximal near the end of inflation, which result in a spectral density of Gravitational Waves (GW) peaked at frequencies $f \sim O(10^3-10^5)$ Hz today, and with an amplitude $\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-8}$.

This metastability has important cosmological implications, because large fluctuations in the Higgs field could trigger vacuum decay in the early universe. For the false vacuum to survive, interactions which stabilize the Higgs during inflation -- e.g., inflaton-Higgs interactions or non-minimal couplings to gravity -- are typically necessary. However, the post-inflationary preheating dynamics of these same interactions could also trigger vacuum decay, thereby recreating the problem we sought to avoid. This dynamics is often assumed catastrophic for models exhibiting scale invariance since these generically allow for unimpeded growth of fluctuations. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of such ""massless preheating"" scenarios and show that the competing threats to metastability can nonetheless be balanced to ensure viability. We find that fully accounting for both the backreaction from particle production and the effects of perturbative decays reveals a large number of disjoint ""islands of (meta)stability"" over the parameter space of couplings. Ultimately, the interplay among Higgs-stabilizing interactions plays a significant role, leading to a sequence of dynamical phases that effectively extend the metastable regions to large Higgs-curvature couplings."
Non-Gaussianity and the induced gravitational wave background,"Peter Adshead, Kaloian D. Lozanov, Zachary J. Weiner",2105.01659,astro-ph.CO,10.1088/1475-7516/2021/10/080,72,"Scalar metric fluctuations generically source a spectrum of gravitational waves at second order in perturbation theory, poising gravitational wave experiments as potentially powerful probes of the small-scale curvature power spectrum. We perform a detailed study of the imprint of primordial non-Gaussianity on these induced gravitational waves, emphasizing the role of both the disconnected and connected components of the primoridal trispectrum. Specializing to local-type non-Gaussianity, we numerically compute all contributions and present results for a variety of enhanced primordial curvature power spectra."
Storage Rings and Gravitational Waves: Summary and Outlook,"A. Berlin, M. Brüggen, O. Buchmueller, P. Chen, R.T.

Dependence of the amplitude of gravitational waves from preheating on the inflationary energy scale,"Rong-Gen Cai, Zong-Kuan Guo, Pei-Ze Ding, Cheng-Jie Fu, Jing Liu",2105.00427,astro-ph.CO,10.1103/PhysRevD.105.023507,5,"Stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) receive increasing attention and provide a new possibility to directly probe the early Universe. In the preheating process at the end of inflation, parametric resonance can generate large energy density perturbations and efficiently produce gravitational waves (GWs) which carry unique information about inflation. Since the peak frequency of such GWs is approximately proportional to the inflationary energy scale, $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$, GWs from preheating are expected to be observed by interferometer GW detectors in low-scale inflationary models. We investigate the dependence of the amplitude of such GWs on $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$, and find that the present energy spectrum of these GWs does not depend on $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ only in the case of $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ is above a critical value $\Lambda_{c}$, a parameter depending on the resonance strength. We numerically obtain $\Lambda_{c}$ in terms of the model parameters in linear approximation and then conduct lattice simulations to verify this result. For $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}\lesssim\Lambda_{c}$, the amplitude of GWs quickly decreases with $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ and becomes challenging to observe. In turn, observing such GWs in interferometer detectors also helps to determine $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ and the resonance strength during the preheating."
Low scale leptogenesis and dark matter in the presence of primordial black holes,"Suruj Jyoti Das, Devabrat Mahanta, Debasish Borah",2104.14496,hep-ph,10.1088/1475-7516/2021/11/019,34,"We study the possibility of low scale leptogenesis along with dark matter (DM) in the presence of primordial black holes (PBH). For a common setup to study both leptogenesis and DM we consider the minimal scotogenic model which also explains light neutrino mass at radiative level. While PBH in the mass range of $0.1-10^5$ g can, in principle, affect leptogenesis, the required initial PBH fraction usually leads to overproduction of scalar doublet DM whose thermal freeze-out occurs before PBH evaporation. PBH can lead to non-thermal source of leptogenesis as well as dilution of thermally generated lepton asymmetry via entropy injection, with the latter being dominant. The parameter space of scotogenic model which leads to overproduction of baryon or lepton asymmetry in standard cosmology can be made consistent in the presence of PBH with appropriate initial mass and energy fraction. On the other hand, for such PBH parameters, the scalar DM is constrained to be in light mass regime where its freeze-out occurs after PBH evaporation. We then discuss the possibility of fermion singlet DM with $N_2$ leptogenesis in the same model where due to singlet nature of DM, its connection with PBH parameters and hence leptogenesis becomes stronger compared to the previous case."
Models of binary neutron star remnants with tabulated equations of state,"Panagiotis Iosif, Nikolaos Stergioulas",2104.13672,astro-ph.HE,,8,"The emergence of novel differential rotation laws that can reproduce the rotational profile of binary neutron star merger remnants has opened the way for the construction of equilibrium models with properties that resemble those of remnants in numerical simulations. We construct models of merger remnants, using a recently introduced 4-parameter differential rotation law and three tabulated, zero-temperature equations of state. The models have angular momenta that are determined by empirical relations, constructed through numerical simulations. After a systematic exploration of the parameter space of merger remnant equilibrium sequences, which includes the determination of turning points along constant angular momentum sequences, we find that a particular rotation law can reproduce the threshold mass to prompt collapse to a black hole with a relative difference of only $\sim 1\%$ with respect to numerical simulations, in all cases considered. Furthermore, our results indicate a possible correlation between the compactness of equilibrium models of remnants at the threshold mass and the compactness of maximum-mass nonrotating models. Another key prediction of binary neutron star merger simulations is a relatively slowly rotating inner region, where the angular velocity $\Omega$ (as measured by an observer at infinity) is mostly due to the frame dragging angular velocity $\omega$. In our investigation of the parameter space of the adopted differential rotation law, we naturally find quasi-spherical (Type A) remnant models with this property. Our investigation clarifies the impact of the differential rotation law and of the equation of state on key properties of binary neutron star remnants and lays the groundwork for including thermal effects in future studies."
Higher-order corrections to the bubble-nucleation rate at finite temperature,Andreas Ekstedt,2104.11804,hep-ph,10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-10130-5,20,"In this paper I discuss how to consistently incorporate higher-order corrections to the bubble-nucleation rate at finite temperature. Doing so I examine the merits of different approaches, with the goal of reducing uncertainties for gravitational-wave calculations. To be specific, the region of applicability and accuracy of the derivative expansion is discussed. The derivative expansion is then compared to a numerical implementation of the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem. Both methods are applied to popular first-order phase transition models, like a loop-induced barrier and a SM-EFT tree-level barrier. The results of these calculations are presented in easy-to-use parametrizations that can directly be used in gravitational-wave calculations. In addition, higher-order corrections for models with multiple scalar fields, such as singlet/triplet extensions, are studied. Lastly, the convergence and uncertainty of all calculations are discussed in detail. And I argue that leading-order results for the Standard Model with a tree-level barrier might be inaccurate."
Chiral gravitational effect in time-dependent backgrounds,"Kohei Kamada, Jun'ya Kume, Yusuke Yamada",2104.00583,hep-ph,10.1007/JHEP05(2021)292,11,"Gravitational counterpart of the chiral magnetic effect, which is referred as the chiral gravitational effect, can also be of interest in a cosmological setup. In this study, we investigate this effect in the time-dependent chiral asymmetric fermion background and in the expanding spacetime by formulating the effective action of gravitational waves. We also analyze the anomaly equation to see how the backreaction from gravitational waves to thermal chiral plasma occurs. We find that the non-trivial time dependence of chiral chemical potential, which can be induced in some scenarios of baryogenesis, is the key ingredient of the chiral gravitational effect. It turns out that the ""memory"" of the effect is imprinted on the high frequency gravitational waves propagating in the plasma. Cosmological implications and potential effects on the gravitational wave observation are briefly discussed."
The benefits of diligence: how precise are predicted gravitational wave spectra in models with phase transitions?,"Huai-Ke Guo, Kuver Sinha, Daniel Vagie, Graham White",2103.06933,hep-ph,10.1007/JHEP06(2021)164,32,"Models of particle physics that feature phase transitions typically provide predictions for stochastic gravitational wave signals at future detectors and such predictions are used to delineate portions of the model parameter space that can be constrained. The question is: how precise are such predictions? Uncertainties enter in the calculation of the macroscopic thermal parameters and the dynamics of the phase transition itself. We calculate such uncertainties with increasing levels of sophistication in treating the phase transition dynamics. Currently, the highest level of diligence corresponds to careful treatments of the source lifetime; mean bubble separation; going beyond the bag model approximation in solving the hydrodynamics equations and explicitly calculating the fraction of energy in the fluid from these equations rather than using a fit; and including fits for the energy lost to vorticity modes and reheating effects. The lowest level of diligence incorporates none of these effects. We compute the percolation and nucleation temperatures, the mean bubble separation, the fluid velocity, and ultimately the gravitational wave spectrum corresponding to the level of highest diligence for three explicit examples: SMEFT, a dark sector Higgs model, and the real singlet-extended Standard Model (xSM). In each model, we contrast different levels of diligence in the calculation and find that the difference in the final predicted signal can be several orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that calculating the gravitational wave spectrum for particle physics models and deducing precise constraints on the parameter space of such models continues to remain very much a work in progress and warrants care."
Stability of domain walls in models with asymmetric potentials,"Tomasz Krajewski, Jan Henryk Kwapisz, Zygmunt Lalak, Marek Lewicki",2103.03225,astro-ph.CO,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.123522,18,"We study the evolution of cosmological domain walls in models with asymmetric potentials. Our research goes beyond the standard case of spontaneous breaking of an approximate symmetry. When the symmetry is explicitly broken the potential exhibits nearly degenerate minima which can lead to creation of a metastable network of domain walls. The time after which the network will decay depends on the difference of values of the potential in minima, its asymmetry around the maximum separating minima and the bias of the initial distribution of the field. Effect of asymmetry around the maximum separating minima is novel one that we study with a new type of potential. Using numerical lattice simulations we determine relative importance of these factors on decay time of networks for generic potentials. We find that even very small departures from the symmetric initial distribution case lead to rapid decay of the domain wall network. As a result creation of a long lasting network capable of producing observable gravitational wave signals is much more difficult than previously thought. On the other hand details of the shape of the potential turn out to be much less important than was expected and the evolution of network from symmetric distribution is controlled by the difference of values of the potential in the minima."
Quantum frequency interferometry: With applications ranging from gravitational wave detection to dark matter searches,"Richard Howl, Ivette Fuentes",2103.02618,quant-ph,10.1116/5.0084821,4,"We introduce a quantum interferometric scheme that uses states that are sharp in frequency and delocalized in position. The states are frequency modes of a quantum field that is trapped at all times in a finite volume potential, such as a small box potential. This allows for significant miniaturization of interferometric devices. Since the modes are in contact at all times, it is possible to estimate physical parameters of global multi-mode channels. As an example, we introduce a three-mode scheme and calculate precision bounds in the estimation of parameters of two-mode Gaussian channels. This scheme can be implemented in several systems, including superconducting circuits, cavity-QED and cold atoms. We consider a concrete implementation using the ground state and two phononic modes of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. We apply this to show that frequency interferometry can improve the sensitivity of phononic gravitational waves detectors by several orders of magnitude, even in the case that squeezing is much smaller than assumed previously and that the system suffers from short phononic lifetimes. Other applications range from magnetometry, gravimetry and gradiometry to dark matter/energy searches."
Frequency deviations in universal relations of isolated neutron stars and postmerger remnants,"Georgios Lioutas, Andreas Bauswein, Nikolaos Stergioulas",2102.12455,astro-ph.HE,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.043011,26,"We relate the fundamental quadrupolar fluid mode of isolated non-rotating NSs and the dominant oscillation frequency of neutron star merger remnants. Both frequencies individually are known to correlate with certain stellar parameters like radii or the tidal deformability, which we further investigate by constructing fit formulae and quantifying the scatter of the data points from those relations. Furthermore, we compare how individual data points deviate from the corresponding fit to all data points. Considering this point-to-point scatter we uncover a striking similarity between the frequency deviations of perturbative data for isolated NSs and of oscillation frequencies of rapidly rotating, hot, massive merger remnants. The correspondence of frequency deviations in these very different stellar systems points to an underlying mechanism and EoS information being encoded in the frequency deviation. We trace the frequency scatter back to deviations of the tidal Love number from an average tidal Love number for a given stellar compactness. Our results thus indicate a possibility to break the degeneracy between NS radii, tidal deformability and tidal Love number. We also relate frequency deviations to the derivative of the tidal deformability with respect to mass. Our findings generally highlight a possibility to improve GW asteroseismology relations where the systematic behavior of frequency deviations is employed to reduce the scatter in such relationships and consequently increase the measurement accuracy. In addition, we relate the f-mode frequency of static stars and the dominant GW frequency of merger remnants. We find an analytic mapping to connect the masses of both stellar systems, which yields particularly accurate mass-independent relations between both frequencies and between the postmerger frequency and the tidal deformability."
Rare Events Detected with a Bulk Acoustic Wave High Frequency Gravitational Wave Antenna,"Maxim Goryachev, William M. Campbell, Ik Siong Heng, Serge Galliou, Eugene N. Ivanov",2102.05859,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.071102,23,"This work describes the operation of a High Frequency Gravitational Wave detector based on a cryogenic Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) cavity and reports observation of rare events during 153 days of operation over two seperate experimental runs (Run 1 and Run 2). In both Run 1 and Run 2 two modes were simultaneously monitored. Across both runs, the 3rd overtone of the fast shear mode (3B) operating at 5.506 MHz was monitored, while in Run 1 the second mode was chosen to be the 5th OT of the slow shear mode (5C) operating at 8.392 MHz. However, in Run 2 the second mode was selected to be closer in frequency to the first mode, and chosen to be the 3rd overtone of the slow shear mode (3C) operating at 4.993 MHz. Two strong events were observed as transients responding to energy deposition within acoustic modes of the cavity. The first event occurred during Run 1 on the 12/05/2019 (UTC), and was observed in the 5.506 MHz mode, while the second mode at 8.392 MHz observed no event. During Run 2, a second event occurred on the 27/11/2019(UTC) and was observed by both modes. Timing of the events were checked against available environmental observations as well as data from other detectors. Various possibilities explaining the origins of the events are discussed."

Detecting planetary-mass primordial black holes with resonant electromagnetic gravitational-wave detectors,"Nicolas Herman, André Füzfa, Léonard Lehoucq, Sébastien Clesse",2012.12189,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.023524,30,"The possibility to detect gravitational waves (GW) from planetary-mass primordial black hole (PBH) binaries with electromagnetic (EM) detectors of high-frequency GWs is investigated. We consider two patented experimental designs, based on the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, in which incoming GWs passing through a static magnetic field induce EM excitations inside either a TM cavity or a TEM waveguide. The frequency response of the detectors is computed for post-newtonian GW waveforms. We find that such EM detectors based on current technology may achieve a strain sensitivity down to $h \sim 10^{-30}$, which generates an EM power variation of $10^{-10}$ W. This allows the detection of PBH binary mergers of mass around $10^{-5} M_\odot$ if they constitute more than $0.01$ percent of the dark matter, as suggested by recent microlensing observations. We envision that this class of detectors could also be used to detect cosmological GW backgrounds and probe sources in the early Universe at energies up to the GUT scale."

Oscillations in the stochastic gravitational wave background from sharp features and particle production during inflation,"Jacopo Fumagalli, Sébastien Renaux-Petel, Lukas T. Witkowski",2012.02761,astro-ph.CO,10.1088/1475-7516/2021/08/030,107,"We identify a characteristic pattern in the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave background from particle production during inflation. If particle production is sufficiently efficient, the scalar power spectrum exhibits $\mathcal{O}(1)$ oscillations periodic in $k$, characteristic of a sharp feature, with an exponentially enhanced envelope. We systematically study the properties of the induced spectrum of gravitational waves sourced after inflation and find that this inherits the periodic structure in $k$, resulting in a peak in the gravitational wave energy density spectrum with $\mathcal{O}(10 \%)$ modulations. The frequency of the oscillation in the scalar power spectrum is determined by the scale of the feature during inflation and in turn sets the frequency of modulations in the gravitational wave signal. We present an explicit realisation of this phenomenon in the framework of multifield inflation, in the form of a strong sharp turn in the inflationary trajectory. The resulting stochastic background is potentially detectable in future gravitational wave observatories, and considerations of backreaction and perturbativity can be used to constrain the parameter space from the theoretical side. Our work motivates more extensive research linking primordial features to observable properties of the stochastic background of gravitational waves, and dedicated development in data analysis for their detection."
Gravitational wave spectra from oscillon formation after inflation,"Takashi Hiramatsu, Evangelos I. Sfakianakis, Masahide Yamaguchi",2011.12201,hep-ph,10.1007/JHEP03(2021)021,30,"We systematically investigate the preheating behavior of single field inflation with an oscillon-supporting potential. We compute the properties of the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) and the number density and characteristics of the produced oscillons. By performing numerical simulations for a variety of potential types, we divide the analyzed potentials in two families, each of them containing potentials with varying large- or small-field dependence. We find that the shape and amplitude of the emitted GW spectrum have a universal feature, with the peak around the physical wavenumber $k/a \sim m$ at the inflaton oscillation period, irrespective of the exact potential shape. This can be used as a smoking-gun for deducing the existence of a violent preheating phase and possible oscillon formation after inflation. Despite this apparent universality, we find differences in the shape of the emitted GW spectra between the two potential families, leading to discriminating features between them. In particular, all potentials show the emergence of a two-peak structure in the GW spectrum, arising at the time of oscillon formation. However, potentials exhibiting efficient parametric resonance tend to smear out this structure and by the end of the simulation the GW spectrum exhibits a single broad peak. We further compute the properties of the produced oscillons for each potential, finding differences in the number density and size distribution of stable oscillons and transient overdensities. We perform a linear fluctuation analysis and use Floquet charts to relate the results of our simulations to the structure of parametric resonance. We find that the growth rate of scalar perturbations and the associated oscillon formation time are sensitive to the small-field potential shape while the macroscopic physical properties of oscillons (e.g. total number) depend on the large-field potential shape."
Gravitational Waves as a Big Bang Thermometer,"Andreas Ringwald, Jan Schütte-Engel, Carlos Tamarit",2011.04731,hep-ph,10.1088/1475-7516/2021/03/054,55,"There is a guaranteed background of stochastic gravitational waves produced in the thermal plasma in the early universe.

As an example of a non-minimal extension of the SM we consider the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).

Searching for New Physics with a Levitated-Sensor-Based Gravitational-Wave Detector,"Nancy Aggarwal, George P. Winstone, Mae Teo, Masha Baryakhtar, Shane L. Larson",2010.13157,gr-qc,10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.111101,55,The Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD) is a compact resonant gravitational-wave (GW) detector based on optically trapped dielectric particles that is under construction. The LSD sensitivity has more favorable frequency scaling at high frequencies compared to laser interferometer detectors such as LIGO. We propose a method to substantially improve the sensitivity by optically levitating a multi-layered stack of dielectric discs. These stacks allow the use of a more massive levitated object while exhibiting minimal photon recoil heating due to light scattering. Over an order of magnitude of unexplored frequency space for GWs above 10 kHz is accessible with an instrument 10 to 100 meters in size. Particularly motivated sources in this frequency range are gravitationally bound states of QCD axions with decay constant near the grand unified theory (GUT) scale that form through black hole superradiance and annihilate to GWs. The LSD is also sensitive to GWs from binary coalescence of sub-solar-mass primordial black holes and as-yet unexplored new physics in the high-frequency GW window.
Fast gravitational wave bursts from axion clumps,"Sichun Sun, Yun-Long Zhang",2003.10527,hep-ph,10.1103/PhysRevD.104.103009,17,"The axion objects such as axion mini-clusters and axion clouds around spinning black holes induce parametric resonances of electromagnetic waves through the axion-photon interaction. In particular, it has been known that the resonances from the axion with the mass around $10^{-6}$eV may explain the observed fast radio bursts (FRBs). Here we argue that similar bursts of high frequency gravitational waves, which we call the fast gravitational wave bursts (FGBs), are generated from axion clumps with the presence of gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) coupling. The typical frequency is half of the axion mass, which in general can range from kHz to GHz. We also discuss the secondary gravitational wave production associated with FRB, as well as the possible host objects of the axion clouds, such as primordial black holes with typical masses around $10^{-5}M_{\odot}$. Future detections of FGBs together with the observed FRBs are expected to provide more evidence for the axion."
