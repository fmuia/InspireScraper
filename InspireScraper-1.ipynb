       "      <td>Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPOs) analysis is important for understanding the dynamical behavior of many astrophysical objects during transient events such as gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, magnetar flares, and fast radio bursts. In this paper, we analyze QPO data in low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems, using the Lense-Thirring, Kerr, and approximate Zipoy-Voorhees metrics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of spin and quadrupole parameters modifies the well-established results for the fundamental frequencies in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We interpret the QPO data within the framework of the standard relativistic precession model, allowing us to infer the values of the mass, spin, and quadrupole parameters of neutron stars in LMXBs. We explore recent QPO data sets from eight distinct LMXBs, assess their optimal parameters, and compare our findings with results in the existing literature. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings.</td>\n",

As a consequence, we argue that coupling constants in generalized gravity theories should be considered as thermodynamic variables, giving raise to extended versions of black hole thermodynamics.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We investigate the accuracy of the perturbative galaxy bias expansion in view of the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy samples. We compare the performance of an Eulerian galaxy bias expansion, using state-of-art prescriptions from the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS), against a hybrid approach based on Lagrangian perturbation theory and high-resolution simulations. These models are benchmarked against comoving snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulation at $z=(0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8)$, which have been populated with H$\\alpha$ galaxies leading to catalogues of millions of objects within a volume of about $58\\,h^{-3}\\,{\\rm Gpc}^3$. Our analysis suggests that both models can be used to provide a robust inference of the parameters $(h, \\omega_{\\rm c})$ in the redshift range under consideration, with comparable constraining power. We additionally determine the range of validity of the EFTofLSS model in terms of scale cuts and model degrees of freedom. From these tests, it emerges that the standard third-order Eulerian bias expansion can accurately describe the full shape of the real-space galaxy power spectrum up to the maximum wavenumber $k_{\\rm max}=0.45\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, even with a measurement precision well below the percent level. In particular, this is true for a configuration with six free nuisance parameters, including local and non-local bias parameters, a matter counterterm, and a correction to the shot-noise contribution. Fixing either tidal bias parameters to physically-motivated relations still leads to unbiased cosmological constraints. We finally repeat our analysis assuming a volume that matches the expected footprint of Euclid, but without considering observational effects, as purity and completeness, showing that we can get consistent cosmological constraints over this range of scales and redshifts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In this work, we consider the effects of repulsive gravity in an invariant way for four static 3D regular black holes, using the eigenvalues of the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci scalar, and the strong energy conditions. The eigenvalues of the solutions are non-vanishing asymptotically (in asymptotically AdS) and increase as the source of gravity is approached, providing a radius at which the passage from attractive to repulsive gravity might occur. We compute the onsets and the regions of repulsive gravity and conclude that the regular behavior of the solutions at the origin of coordinates can be interpreted as due to the presence of repulsive gravity, which also turns out to be related with the violation of the strong energy condition. We showed that in all of the solutions for the allowed region of parameters, gravity changes its sign, but the repulsive regions only for the non-logarithmic solution are affected by the mass that generates the regular black hole. The repulsive regions for the logarithmic solutions are dependent on electric charge and the AdS$_{3}$ length. The implications and physical consequences of these results are discussed in detail.</td>\n",

In this paper, we analyze QPO data in low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems, using the Lense-Thirring, Kerr, and approximate Zipoy-Voorhees metrics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of spin and quadrupole parameters modifies the well-established results for the fundamental frequencies in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We interpret the QPO data within the framework of the standard relativistic precession model, allowing us to infer the values of the mass, spin, and quadrupole parameters of neutron stars in LMXBs. We explore recent QPO data sets from eight distinct LMXBs, assess their optimal parameters, and compare our findings with results in the existing literature. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings.  \n",

Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we show that black holes should be considered as quasi-homogeneous systems. As a consequence, we argue that coupling constants in generalized gravity theories should be considered as thermodynamic variables, giving raise to extended versions of black hole thermodynamics.  \n",
       "2    We investigate the accuracy of the perturbative galaxy bias expansion in view of the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy samples. We compare the performance of an Eulerian galaxy bias expansion, using state-of-art prescriptions from the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS), against a hybrid approach based on Lagrangian perturbation theory and high-resolution simulations. These models are benchmarked against comoving snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulation at $z=(0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8)$, which have been populated with H$\\alpha$ galaxies leading to catalogues of millions of objects within a volume of about $58\\,h^{-3}\\,{\\rm Gpc}^3$. Our analysis suggests that both models can be used to provide a robust inference of the parameters $(h, \\omega_{\\rm c})$ in the redshift range under consideration, with comparable constraining power. We additionally determine the range of validity of the EFTofLSS model in terms of scale cuts and model degrees of freedom. From these tests, it emerges that the standard third-order Eulerian bias expansion can accurately describe the full shape of the real-space galaxy power spectrum up to the maximum wavenumber $k_{\\rm max}=0.45\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, even with a measurement precision well below the percent level. In particular, this is true for a configuration with six free nuisance parameters, including local and non-local bias parameters, a matter counterterm, and a correction to the shot-noise contribution. Fixing either tidal bias parameters to physically-motivated relations still leads to unbiased cosmological constraints. We finally repeat our analysis assuming a volume that matches the expected footprint of Euclid, but without considering observational effects, as purity and completeness, showing that we can get consistent cosmological constraints over this range of scales and redshifts.  \n",

The eigenvalues of the solutions are non-vanishing asymptotically (in asymptotically AdS) and increase as the source of gravity is approached, providing a radius at which the passage from attractive to repulsive gravity might occur. We compute the onsets and the regions of repulsive gravity and conclude that the regular behavior of the solutions at the origin of coordinates can be interpreted as due to the presence of repulsive gravity, which also turns out to be related with the violation of the strong energy condition. We showed that in all of the solutions for the allowed region of parameters, gravity changes its sign, but the repulsive regions only for the non-logarithmic solution are affected by the mass that generates the regular black hole. The repulsive regions for the logarithmic solutions are dependent on electric charge and the AdS$_{3}$ length. The implications and physical consequences of these results are discussed in detail.  \n",

We summarize current methods for construction and analysis of vacua with stabilized moduli, and we describe applications to cosmology and particle physics.
